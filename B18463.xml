            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable JAMES EARL OF PERTH, &amp;c. Lord High-Chancellor OF SCOTLAND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NOW when the whole Kingdom is resounding with the loudest Acclamations of Joy for that late Felicity, which our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious KING has vouchsaft us, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing upon us such a Chancellor, as equally answers all our <hi>former,</hi> and even puts to silence the most eager of our <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Wishes; I may (I doubt not) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<pb facs="tcp:204593:5"/> upon a favourable Smile to be deign'd this small Mite of Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which my Zealous, tho poor En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours throngs in with the publick Croud.</p>
            <p>And altho such Addresses, upon the like Occasion, use rather to be interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the environing World, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the insinuative and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Streins of Flat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery and Complement, and such Courtly Shadows, as only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and await upon Greatness and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment: Yet the universal evidence of real exultancy which appears because of Your Lordships Promotion (whereby 'tis hard to distinguish whether every one resents more the new Accession to Your Lordships Glory, or That to the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which he shares in the common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his whole Nation), takes off all reasonable suspition of any such base and unworthy intendments from Those, which nothing can restrain from the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of pressing forward to express the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous acknowledgments, It does every where engage. And he that would aim
<pb facs="tcp:204593:5"/> at accoasting Your Lordship with any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joling or adulatory methods, behov'd, not only to be ignorant how ungrateful all such are to that sincerest Modesty, which is the very Enamel and Decorement of those other radiant Vertues whereby Your Lordship is so eminently ennobled and adorned; but also to contrive new Raptures for his Blandishments, which never yet any under that Name were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed unto, when to say of Your Lordship but what You justly deserve, would entirely exhaust whatever has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been soar'd the most highly in the wonted Eulogies and Praises: Neither of which I shall ever be guilty.</p>
            <p>But, My Lord, I presume that towards a Year agoe it was made known to Your Lordship, that I was design'd to prostrate the first of my Labours at Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships feet, there to show with what Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration Your Lordships Vertues and Noble Learning (which mutually bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows from, and adds Lustre unto These, and Your Noble Self) did overtake a Man, whom no other bonds could tye
<pb facs="tcp:204593:6"/> to any such Admiration and Regard; as never yet having been so far honoured, as to be but once more seen in the face by Your Lordship, than any of those nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Throngs which constantly flock with ravishment to behold the Ornament and Darling of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation. And so it is still the Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> whose Name I-have dar'd to prefix unto these Papers, and not the Chancellor; or only the Chancellor, because it is the Earl of <hi>Perth</hi> that is He.</p>
            <p>That our present happiness in Your Lordship may continue while a <hi>sero in Coelum redeas</hi> be at once wholly applyed and verified, is undoubtedly the fervent Prayer of every one, who loves the True Religion, his KING, and Countrey, and own self; but especially of,</p>

            <head>The Occasion.</head>
            <p>AFter I had returned from <hi>Rome,</hi> it was impos'd upon me to give an account of its Religion. Whereupon I wrote several Papers upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Infallibility of that church. But having observ'd that the Threed of the Discourse was sometimes interrupted by following the Analogy betwixt the prior Dispensations to the Christian, and it, wherein the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> fancy they find mighty advantage; I thought it would not be amiss, should I, by way of <hi>Apparatus,</hi> draw up the whole Scheme of the several Dispensations whereby GOD has manifested himself to the World; that so, in pursuance of my former Theme, I might but refer to it, when ever the occasion requir'd that I should run the parallel betwixt any of them. And therefore I wrote some few Sheets to that purpose; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I did especially consider the <hi>intrinsick sufficiency</hi> of the Manifestation in all the several Stages and Revolutions of the Church.</p>
            <p>But before I could accomplish my first Task (for since ever I came back to <hi>Scotland</hi> my condition has been such, that I could not do any thing but by snatches), I bethought me of another design, which might still be subservient to the former, and perhaps be no less <hi>taking,</hi> nor <hi>useful</hi> either, than it: Which was the Resolving of Faith; and therein shewing that the Papists do endeavour to rob us of our Reason and Senses too, and overturn that <hi>rational certainty</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> which we have of the truth of the Christian Religion. And this I brought very mear to a close. So that of the two Discourses I have at least about fourty Sheets.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:204593:7"/>
            <p>But at last some pressing circumstances having even forc'd me now to appear in publick, I resolv'd to take my hazard of that little Discourse which I had wrote as an <hi>Apparatus</hi> to the rest, and thereby make an essay how my way of writing would relish the World. And so I went to the Press. It is true I had but then about eight Sheets of it in Copy, tho within these five Weeks since, it has swel'd to the bulk whereof now it is. But in the interim I judg'd it pertinent to joyn the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick sufficiency</hi> of the Manifestation, with the <hi>intrinsick,</hi> that as the <hi>one</hi> might serve the Discourse about the boasted Infallibility of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> so the <hi>other</hi> might That about the Resolution of Faith, and demonstrating the <hi>evident truth</hi> of the Christian Religion against the Papists, who both expressly deny, and hold such Principles and Opinions as quite supplant it.</p>
            <p>BUT I perswade my self that even abstracting from all this, my pains in this Discourse shall not be in vain. For tho the World be almost nauseated with Books on this Subject, yet he must be a great stranger in it who knows not, that the need of reinforcing assaults on that head is not one whit less than ever: There being hardly any more a-la-mode entertainment than to droll and baffle Religion, as if it were the only thing which deserv'd most to be hiss't at, and houted out of all rational and virtuoso Company. So that tho there be many that carry the Name of Christians, yet, alas! it is to be feared there is not such a number of those, who own the Power, which should influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence all that are really such.</p>
            <p>Besides, Even among those who truly do so, there are too many that flatter themselves with a superficial and perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious belief of its Doctrines: so that if they have learned but the very first Alphabet and Catechism of it in their younger years, they think they need not any more for their whole life thereafter; as if they had already provided themselves abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly of all that were lookt upon as <hi>Necessary:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cared not to busie their heads with what were consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially no more but <hi>arbitrary</hi> and <hi>superfluous.</hi> Whereas, has GOD been so vouchsafing as to display himself to Mankind at that
<pb facs="tcp:204593:7"/> rate, at which this Discourse has shewed he has done; and shall any read that, and yet satisfie himself with such course and vulgar notions of him, or such a general confus'd know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Mysteries of that Religion, which he has so indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously imparted? And therefore to both these sorts of People this Discourse may fortune not to be altogether impertinent.</p>
            <p>Far be it from me to be either so arrogant or presumptuous, as vainly to fancy that my poor endeavours shall prove successful where so many excellent and vigorous Addresses has been repel'd and come off with an affront; if to be so miserably frustrated can be reputed one. But I behov'd to comply with what I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before. And perhaps there may be some one thing or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in mine, that may touch some one body or another, which would read over all those more elaborate Writings with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect coldness and indifferency. And if there be, all my labour is but too much recompensed. Besides the newness of a thing uses to recommend it, when nothing else can do that.</p>
            <p>Indeed this may be called new, tho there should not be so much as one Consideration in it that were so. Because I owe it pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Bible and my own reeflections: having been so very jealous to avoid being a Plagiary on a Subject that is so trite and common, that, from my first beginning to write while I put an end to it, I carefully declin'd the looking but never so overly into any Book of this nature; save it was that sacred one, wherein our Religion is most divinely established. So that I have taken the adventure to present the World with my own native and genuine thoughts, and such Observations as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a serious perusing and considering the Holy Bible did suggest unto me.</p>
            <p>SOME perhaps will be stumbled at several of my arguings drawn from the Attributs of GOD; as if they were not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectfully exprest, as such a dreadful and sacred subject seems to require they should be. But all such must know, that all those flow from the Principles of our Natural Religion, and the dictats of meer Reason. Now we have no other way from these, to judge of any End that GOD could design in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence toward Man, but by considering the agreeableness of it
<pb facs="tcp:204593:8"/> with those adorable Perfections which shine from his Nature and Essence. And therefore there is no other <hi>Medium</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we can conclude that such or such an end could not have mov'd him, but what can be gathered from the absurdities that would follow from the comparing of it with his glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributs. And he knows ill how to manage an Argument <hi>ab absurdo,</hi> who makes it not as odious as he can.</p>
            <p>But then the <hi>odiousness</hi> and <hi>absurdity</hi> falls not upon the thing it self absolutely considered, but only upon it as it lyes under such or such a Supposition. And so, the inference of <hi>these</hi> does but remove from it that other thing which is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; because, since nothing can devolve such an odiousness or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity upon what is essentially uncapable of being justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht with either (as every thing must be, which can be the Subject of such an Argument), the proving, that from such a supposition such an absurdity would inevitably follow, does ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly but prove, that such a supposition can never be more but a bare supposition for argument sake, or that it is impossible that things can be really so as they are suppos'd. And this, as is clear, is so far from involving any disrespect to that thing from which that supposition is remov'd, that on the contrary, it argues the greatest regard unto it imaginable; when it suffers not any thing to be compatible with it that would infer such an absurdity and odiousness upon it.</p>
            <p>Thus it is that GOD is demonstrated not to be possibly the Author of Sin, by an argument drawn from his Holiness, and what an absurdity would ensue, if it were contaminated and defil'd with those loathsome pollutions which frail crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can be guilty of. And who can fancy that GOD is any wise disparag'd by the most odious consequences that could be gathered from his being so suppos'd to be the Author of what is so repugnant to that One of his Attributes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the like must be said in reference to the respective suppositions under which the rest can proportionably fall. And so the charging of GOD with <hi>Foolishness,</hi> or <hi>Injustice.</hi> or <hi>Cruelty,</hi> or <hi>Rigour,</hi> &amp;c. under such suppositions; sounds no more harshly, than under another, to call him an Adulterer, a Thoremonger, a Murderer, or Thief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where, it being
<pb facs="tcp:204593:8"/> palpable that he cannot possibly be either, there is no affront done to his sacred Name, by such suppos'd imputations; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by an evident argument upon <hi>that</hi> account, he is prov'd not to be such as would infer them.</p>
            <p>But he must be very disingenuous, who does not acknowledge with what veneration and prostrate regard every Page of this Discourse treats the Divine Majesty: his absolute Power and Soveraignty being exalted by it, above all that we can either think or imagine: and all his several Attributs considered with such a becoming relation to one another, as their all being infinite can possibly exact: so that we have Reason to guess what may belong to what is so.</p>
            <p>AS for the Style; I confess I am somewhat suspitious, now when I see it in print, that in some places it may give occasion to the sullen and morose part of the World to construct that there is more than enough of affectation in it. But none will make such a gloss who truly knows me. For had I been, either of the humour, or at the pains, as to affect Language, I might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have pleas'd them better. But the truth is, I have ever looked upon the wording of a thing, as but an outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance wherein a man may take his own liberty. And therefore I have, out of a certain kind of ingenuity, indulg'd the present fancy of expressing my self, so as at every opportunity it offered it self unto me. Neither use I to notice any thing of a Book so much, as the Method and contrivance, the close pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of the main design, and with what solid and convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reason and sense it manages that. And I presume to assure my self that mine has not fail'd too sorely in either of these. And so let such People think of the Strain what they will, I am not much to trouble my self. Assuredly no more, than if I should be challenged because the Cuff of my Coat sleeve were not of that exactly modish Cut which anothers is of.</p>
            <p>Truly I use to laugh when I hear of a <hi>Fashion</hi> of Language, as if forsooth there <hi>ought</hi> to be any other, whatever there <hi>may</hi> be, than that which can best serve to make ones conceipts to be understood; so that the words be not exotick or flatly strain'd: And some can only do that in long and fluent Periods: some
<pb facs="tcp:204593:9"/> only in short and little brisk Sentences. But in that, if ever any where, <hi>unusquisque suo sensu abundet,</hi> should take place. And he that would either rack up, or pare off all Language while it was exactly conform to some <hi>Procrustes</hi>'s Bed would certainly exercise no less Tyrrany, than did he, who treated the very bodies of Men at that cruel rate.</p>
            <p>I am indeed of the opinion, that ordinarily the more rolling Sentences, providing they be not intricat nor entangled, use to contract and couch more matter in less room, than can those that are of the precise Laconick size: as let any try the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment I'll undertake to show. However if I be guilty of any too much flaunting luxuriancy, it is on the extream, which, I hope. I can much sooner mend, than can he That, who must write sordidly do what he will. And this shall be the last time that I shall have the least shadow of any need for such an Apology, let me have never so little of it now. Only I hope there will be some allowance for one whose years are yet on this side thirty, as to the matter of too much fluency in his language.</p>
            <p>And I would desire that none would look upon this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, with any relation to the circumstances of the Author; or as accommodated to suit the peculiar strains of any Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: for each have their several Airs and Meens. And so I would not have it thought as any wise fit, either for the Pulpit, or any other place where men use to declaim or harangue: since I know that, in several places especially, nothing would be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent for any of them and on set purpose I suffer'd it to be such.</p>
            <p>AND as for those wry Mouths, and petulant saucy Tongues, which seem to have been only shaped for some jest or sarcasme; let them blurt out whatever happens first to come within their teeth; they shall no more move me, nor can the Moon be, at the spightful snarle and bark of an ugly Cur.</p>
            <p>But I have not seldom seen such censorious People virulently carp at an expression, which themselves knew not how to better, when put to it to do so, because they took it so severely to task. And I would not wish any body to be foil'd at a more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous rate, or more flatly to betray themselves, than thus to be found challenging what it had not been in their own power to
<pb facs="tcp:204593:9"/> have secur'd from those their own cavils. For thus they detect their ill nature, and nothing besides. And to do that is the wofullest mischief one can do himself.</p>
            <p>FOR a proof of my candour and ingenuity in all this, I shall alledge no more, but that in publishing this Book, I have not condescended to be so far fashionable, as to do it in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade, and either leave the Title Page with a blank for the Authors Name while a second occasion, or borrow and feign another for concealing it. Indeed had one already gain'd cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and renown to his Writings, it might be very justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed a peice of humility and self-denial in him to steal out his Books so clandestinely into the World, as that the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive and curious search to find out the true Author, might learn no more, but what it were to meet with a defeat and disappointment. But for one, who never before had any experiment how his Works would take, to detrect the running the risk of such an adventure and suppress who it was that gave the World the occasion of being perhaps troubled with such Books as would not quite the cost and the pains; that certainly could never fall under so favourable an interpretation; and any body would think he had but purposely kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out of the way from those direct revenges▪ at least, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he was jealous, too many would pursue him, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the money and labour he had engaged them to mispend (tho it would not be altogether without their own fault that they did so, when none uses to be forc'd, either to buy, or read a Book). And so, since the first time that one appears in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, he does it at an hazard; he ought assuredly to be sooner taxt of any thing else, than any disingenuous, or ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, who as publickly exposes himself to all the inconveniencies of that danger which he incurs, as he does That by which he incurs it, and becomes obnoxious unto them. So that had there been either policy or design in my view, these Papers had never carried before them any such Name as <hi>James Canaries;</hi> especially when my circumstances are such, as make me yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the World for my fortune in it. But however that shall come about, I must, and will still follow that openness
<pb facs="tcp:204593:10"/> and freedom of Spirit; against which hardly any interest can be so prevalent, as to make me, either disguise or dissemble it. And I must ly long at the Pool of Preferment, before any very artificial complyance, or cunning methods, help down my lame Accomplishments into the Waters. And therefore, with such as they are I intend to crawl out the plain, honest, simple road.</p>
            <p>There is indeed another end, than what has been insinuated, for which one might send out anonymous Pieces; <hi>viz.</hi> that his own Name (not being perchance so famous as were requisite) might not be any wise prejudicial to those Works which thus he fears to own. Since▪ as there is nothing more common, than for a buzzing Authority to recompense even real weaknesses, which he, whose Name struts begly with it, is guilty of; so, on the other hand, it is no less ordinary for a good cause, not ill manag'd, to suffer upon the account of the obscureness of that Person, who set his hand to it: the vulgar part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind using more to notice, <hi>who</hi> it was that wrote, than <hi>what</hi> it is that it written. But that is such a childish and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable prejudice in them, that be were more justly to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with both the Epithets than they, who would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the least mite to humour them in it. And Sense is still Sense, from whatever coast it came, to any man that deserves to be character'd as one of it, or understanding.</p>
            <p>IN fine then, If I have done well, I'll be encouraged to do more. If I have but done so and so, I'll yet make another tryal to see if I can do better. For I have not embarkt all my Repute in this first Piece. And the whole loss needs be but mine. So I bid my Reader adieu with that just and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Demand</p>

               <p n="1">1. GOD surely, in the Creation of Man, cannot be suppos'd to have breath'd <hi>the breath of life into his nostrils,</hi> and to a Body of the most delicate and wonderful composure, such as (though there had been no more, yet) had irrefragably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested Him by whose <hi>finger</hi> it was fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, have joyn'd a spiritual and heavenly substance, enriched with all those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Faculties and decorements which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:204593:11"/> it the liveliest Image and resemblance of the <hi>Father of Spirits</hi> himself; for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, than only for a while, <hi>either</hi> to whirle about and perplex his curious Brains with some few empty and fruitless Speculations, from which he could not reap the leaft moment of any solid and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al satisfaction proportionable even to the pains he had laid out in his indefatigable re-search after them; <hi>or else</hi> to swill and gratifie all those luxurious appetites and desires which his sanguine and pampered Flesh could itch him withal, but which needed no other Soul, save that of the meerest Animal, to fit any thing for the being abundantly sensible of their highest relish and transports; and <hi>then,</hi> after that little, but <hi>troublesome</hi> or <hi>degenerate</hi> abode in the world, to crumble again, like <hi>the beasts that perish,</hi> unto that former Dust and Nothing whence at first he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and thus miserably dwindle and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish away unto the damping shades of perpetual darkness and oblivion. For who does not see that then, in framing such an accomplished Creature for no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204593:11"/> finer purpose but <hi>these,</hi> he had acted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more unworthily his own Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty self, than could that veriest Drudge he had made, when so basely and pitifully employed below the dignity and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those Rational Powers wherewith he was endowed? The distance between the illimited Wisdom, and Power, and Goodness, and Sanctity of that Supream Essence, and such an <hi>unmeet</hi> and <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> production, as would have been Man for those Vain and Ignoble ends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incomparably more vast than <hi>any</hi> that can be fancied between him, and the most trifling or abject condescentions unto which he could be defigned to stoop. So does <hi>that first one</hi> result with such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled excess and transcendency from <hi>this other.</hi> Now those same very Reasons wherewith we are so eminently adorned, cannot but suggest such becoming thoughts of That which is originally lodged in the Divinity from whom we derived them, as, though purely upon their own account they would not vindicate themselves from the disgraceful and most calumnious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204593:12"/> of having been only made to truckle unto such mean and sordid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, yet in regard of It, to force us abhor the monstruous blasphemy of asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him with any so ridiculous and absurd a contrivance, which, notwithstanding he does all things in <hi>number, weight,</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> would inevitably infer he had forgot to observe the just measures, both of his own self, and also of that Beeing he had so liberally imparted himself unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Shall it therefore be thought, that, even although he intended him no future recompence to prompt and encourage his endeavours, yet he had bestowed such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Induements upon him, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of those <hi>suitable</hi> returns, which justly enough he might expect from one to whom he had been so profusely bountiful and vouchsafing: and so, that he would studiously exert them into performances of so elevated a nature as could reflect nothing but praise and repute upon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>immediate,</hi> or <hi>more remote</hi> Source from which they did issue; they being all the <hi>genuine,</hi> and consequently the <hi>vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:204593:12"/> exercises of untainted and triumphing Reason. And indeed there are such strong ties in Gratitude, and such amiable and inveagling charms and allurements in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the loveliest of all Beauties, when lookt upon with any serious and uncloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eye; as that none (taking notice of things as they lye obvious only to Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) but would conclude it were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impossible for any Rational Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either to be so unthankful to its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, as not to be alwayes most anxious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that wherein his Honour and Glory were concerned; or yet so hugely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate of its own interest, as to neglect or abandon what were so very capable to enhance and adorn it, and to yield it those purer and refin'd satisfactions, which are most <hi>congruous,</hi> and therefore most <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing</hi> to that its generous and immaterial complexion, whereof nothing, but that it owed it not to its own self, could keep it from being proud and ostentive. But, alas! How much does equally <hi>woful</hi> and <hi>daily</hi> Experience quite baffle and confound all the most flattering appearance of that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204593:13"/> goodly Scheme and Contemplation? And is there any who may not hourly observe how much, in this present order of things, the Bruitish and Sensitive part of man has obtain'd the domineering ascendant over the Rational and Divine; how much the poor deprav'd Creature is dragg'd and hurried head-long whithersoever the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troling violence of inordinate and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Passions does push and compel him; and how prevalent an influence these ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous Usurpers gets upon that very Soul which they so sadly do enslave, as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to force even its nicest judgement and discretion, and make it subscribe to its own Vassalage, by <hi>thinking</hi> that best, which it has come to <hi>like</hi> so? And all this, even where such a Religion, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the most transcendent rewards, and threatens no less dreadful punishments, does universally possess the belief and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of men. And so <hi>quam rara avis in terris,</hi> how much a Phoenix would any such <hi>Virtuoso</hi> be, as (in this supposition, of no conditional Promises anent a future happiness or misery, to animate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204593:13"/> his obedience) would thus struggle against the Current and Stream of his most beloved and powerful inclinations, and deny himself of all those tickling plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delights which would entice and bewitch him so much in this his frail and carnal estate? And therefore to have made Mankind <hi>only</hi> upon intuition of such difficult and extraordinary improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without any other bonds over it to ingage unto these, than what wer fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned; had undoubtedly as much expos'd the Wisdom of the Maker (not to speak of any other of his Attributes) unto the censure and even ludibrie of those same very Creatures, as their viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices would commonly disappoint and defeat it; and so, as the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his design was obnoxious to the most uncertain contingency and fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness of the meerest adventure. Since nothing can be more apt to devolve the imputation of foolishness upon one, than that he has been at much expence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, without the hopeful prospect of any sure advantage to redound unto him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204593:14"/> from either; but with the clear foresight of <hi>so little,</hi> as could not be considerable in the vast croud of those plentiful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, which only bore proportion unto what ought rationally to have been the full extent and measure of his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But what lump of Earth dares be so insolent, as but to dream that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majesty of Heaven and Earth too, could have so wretchedly sitten beside his Cushion, in any managery of that Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, which borrows all its merit to be ador'd from the Wisdom, no less bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, by which it is governed?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is then most evident that the end for which God did creat Man a Reasonable Beeing was, that, all the rest of this materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al World serving him only by Instinct and the <hi>necessary</hi> Propensions of Nature, he, for whom especially it was made, and who was to be the soveraign Lord and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of it, might do <hi>so</hi> by a <hi>free</hi> and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous obedience; and therefore, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyant with his duty, be eternally blest with the more immediate fruition of His own self, and those most exquisite and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204593:14"/> delights which cannot but slow from such an enjoyment; but if perverse and flagitious, then as eternally consign'd unto all the direful horrours and torments that his provocked. Justice could pour out upon him. For tho upon the score of that absolute dominion which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have over his own Creature and the workmanship of his hands, he might have exacted from him whatever obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance had suited best with his pleasure; and that without the least tender of any reward or compensation, but upon terms of the highest penalties that his infinite Power could inflict: and so he might have got him, either to persist in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable obsequiousness to his Commands; or else to become the miserable object of his utmost Fury and Indignation: and thus glorified himself, if not in the gratitude and submission of such a thing as had purely emerg'd from the arbitrary impulse of his own Will, yet at least in the rigorous punishment and condemnation of its bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est extravagancies and misdemeanors. Yet it can never be imagin'd that He,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204593:15"/> who is no respecter of other Persons, should be so very partial to his own At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, as to promote and advance the glory of any one of them to the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and neglect of any of the rest. And therefore, He not being all Power or Justice, but as much Goodness and Love too, as either; it cannot but be thought that <hi>these</hi> also must equally have their share of what was to result from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that rational Beeing: and so that it was as much to communicate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse himself unto such a Creature, that he condescended to vouchsafe it an existence; as to exerce any irresistible Soveraignty over it, which, by making it to live in a full and constant acknowledgment of its dependence upon him without any other inducement than what arose meerly from its <hi>fears,</hi> could but exalt his Supream Power and Dominion; and would still leave it dubious whether he had any the least tincture of Goodness in him at all. Nay, he is so essentially happy in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal possession of his own Infinite Self, that he can receive no accession to his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:204593:15"/> Bliss by the most exuberant contributions of any thing from without, even tho it were possible for it not to have sprung from the Almighty <hi>Fiat</hi> of his meerest good pleasure; but far less by the poorest endeavours of what borders so much upon Nothing, that as it owes its not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continued always to skulk un-notic'd within the darkest Confines of <hi>that,</hi> pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the voluntary exertion of his Power; so it is unto the same cause it is every Minut beholden for its not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thither again. And since it is thus with him, there can be nothing more palpable, than that the original and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary design upon which he was mov'd to allow any beeing unto Man, was, not to encrease, but impart his Felicity; and consequently that none of his severer At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes could have inclin'd him to rear such an effect, but in so far as they were to take place, after its own self, by its highest ingratitude and prevarications, had become uncapable of his kindness and favours, and demerited to be thrown over unto the harsher methods of his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:204593:16"/> Wrath and Revenge. But yet on the other hand, it was not fit he should have altogether precluded himself from making any other manifestation of his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, than what might appear in one great effort of his Goodness and Bounty. Wherefore, tho these carried him out with the most tender and benign incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations toward that new production which he had made so much to copy and resemble himself; yet had he so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indulg'd them, as, immediatly upon his having created Man, to have rapt him up unto those immortal. Felicities which were <hi>chiefly,</hi> but not <hi>absolutely</hi> intended him; he had left no room in that whole Dispensation, either for his Justice, or Mercy, (those two opposite, but most resplendent Jewels of his eternal Crown) to shine and evidence themselves. As then he made Man a rational and free Agent, that he might be capable as well to <hi>obey,</hi> as <hi>enjoy</hi> himself: So, that none of his Attributes might be smother'd or eclips'd by any of the rest, however propense he was to be good and liberal unto him;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204593:16"/> yet he must have entail'd his being <hi>so,</hi> upon that obedience whereof man himself was to be the sole master, and which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely depended upon the unforced exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his own freedom and liberty: since without he had thus made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationer of him, and then wrought upon his humor with conditional Promises and Threats; it had been perfectly impossible but that some of these his Attributs which now are most conspicuous and wonderful, had to all eternity lyen envelopt in the thickest wrappings of ignorance and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity. And thus we see upon what account Man was made Reasonable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as the first sentence of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph did express it.</p>

But that had been really all one as not to have bound him by any Laws or Duty at all; but granted him the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained freedom of rambling among all things, whether good or bad, if the case can admit of such a distinction, without ever stumbling upon that whose unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness might require the warriness and advertency of his steps: since the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible impulse of the unwieldiest Lust and Sensuality could never have prompted him to a baseness so much <hi>so,</hi> or hurried him head-long upon such loathsome gross abominations, but what he might have hallowed and Baptiz'd by the name of his Devotions, and consecrated by the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent meritorious Titles of Piety and Zeal; the very Bacchanals, and most barbarous inhumanities, being abundantly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd, even to the repute and approbation, and much more <hi>humours</hi> of men, when once they were enhanc'd and ennobled by the Metamorphosis that made them Religion and a honouring of the gods: And so in that <hi>Hypothesis</hi> there could have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:204593:18"/> nothing been thought upon more laudable and becoming, for the Worship of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so perfect an Essence and Divinity.</p>
               <p>Nay moreover, not to have afforded him such Means to square and measure his allegiance and performances by, would have render'd the punishing of him for the Infringment and Prevarication of any <hi>particular</hi> Obligation, and consequently of the <hi>whole</hi> of that duty unto which his Maker had ty'd him, <hi>impossible,</hi> because <hi>unjust;</hi> not to speak of the utmost extent of the Power and Dominion Almighty GOD has over his Creatures: when the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible ignorance,</hi> would have fully excus'd the flattest breach and violation of it. All which evidently would infer that Man is not oblidg'd to any Religious behaviour towards the Author of his beeing; since it does so, that there is no Law unto which That ought to be conformed, nor yet any consequents of one to enforce and secure it; an Obligation without a Law, and <hi>these,</hi> being equally ridiculous and unaccountable. And so it wholly destroys what was lately shown in the fore-going
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204593:18"/> Section, concerning the design for which Man was created.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore it was that <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of Innocence was only bound to what he was inclin'd by the Dictamen and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his own Reason (with whose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beeing and constitution the true noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and apprehensions of a Deity, and that purest Systeme of the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were inseparably blended and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven); and not to venture upon that forbidden Tree, which was <hi>so very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly</hi> interdicted, that even <hi>Eve,</hi> though to gratifie her prurient curiosity, she could dissemble the hazard of relishing that inviting Fruit when the sutlest of Beasts assaulted her with the tentation, could not pretend the faintest umbrage of a scruple, whether it was prohibited or not; but on the contrary, by too great a niceness, lookt on that as unlawful, even so much as to be <hi>toucht,</hi> which was only so to be <hi>eaten.</hi> And so when fond and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Man had yielded unto the blushing (because treacherous) allurements of those more mortiferous, than lusciously
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204593:19"/> painted Apples, and thereby forfeited his Paradise and his Innocence too; and a necessity was introduc'd, either for him to suffer the wages of his transgression, and eternally become the wretched prey of Sin and Death, or else for illimited Mercy to interpose in his behalf, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an expedient by which to rescue him from the cruel Jaws of <hi>both,</hi> and make him again <hi>meet to be partaker of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in light:</hi> GOD whose clemency acknowledges no boundiaries, having listned to the latter, to re-admit him unto his former favour, and confer upon him a new possibility of enjoying himself; did surely condescend also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal unto him those Conditions of that gracious Compact whereunto now he had stoop'd, which were indispensably to be performed by him, if he would not make a second Ship-wrack of the vastest happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he was so resolutely pursued with. And indeed since the Articles of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant he a-fresh entered into with him, were so far above the reach of, not only a lapsed Intellect, but the sublimest of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:204593:19"/> those Spirits which are most intimatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with the hidden things of their Maker, that even Cherubs <hi>desir'd to pry into them;</hi> how sadly had that compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which pitied the wretched estate poor inconsiderate Man had plung'd himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, supplanted and defeated it self, had it denyed him the Keyes which could only open those Doors, thorow which he was of necessity to pass, before the felicity tendered unto him could be arrived at?

               <p n="1">1. CONSEQUENTLY to all which the Scripture tells us how that GOD had no sooner smil'd again upon repenting <hi>Adam,</hi> but he gave him <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Notice of that Messiah, <hi>that Seed of the Woman that should bruife the Serpents head,</hi> upon whose account his Reconciliation with him was wrought, and by Faith in whom he could only be capable to taste the benefite and advantage of it. And certainly, besides the Law of Nature, so indelibly character'd upon his Soul, that nothing but the entire dissolution of the whole frame could totally efface or raze it thence; and therefore, tho much dimm'd and blotted by the fall, yet still conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and legible enough even in that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204593:20"/> dusky twilight whereunto his Reason had now declin'd: besides this, I say, he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther injoyn'd him some <hi>positive</hi> Observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Ceremonies of Devotion, which might carry an <hi>especial regard,</hi> and be <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly adapted</hi> unto that late Agreement, and new Creed concerning a Redeemer; and whereby his Religion might be discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from what the weak glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of shattered Nature could hit or light upon. Which is manifest from that early Victime which his Son <hi>Abel</hi> offered up, no doubt to propitiate and attone Heaven for his sins; and which he could only have learned from his Father, and he from God, by some <hi>positive</hi> Institution. Since 'tis not supposable that ever any of them durst have presum'd to endeavour the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying an offended and angry Divinity with bloudy expiations, if himself had not first instructed them how he could be most acceptably accosted and appeas'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nay since we find that afterwards (in the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dispensation at least) he did appoint such immolations to represent that great Sacrifice which his own Son was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204593:21"/> to offer up of himself in the stead of lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Mankind, and by vertue of their <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical respect</hi> unto It, to be the only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of procuring his pardon for whatever offences had provockt him to wrath and indignation; There lies a force upon us to conclude, that, as immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he had again <hi>lifted up the light of his loving countenance</hi> upon <hi>Adam,</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to him the Gospel and glad tidings of his own consubstantial and eternally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, who should retaliat that foil he had got from the Serpent to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>proportion,</hi> by <hi>being born of a Woman,</hi> and taking that Nature upon him which it had so successfully assaulted, that even with humane feet he might kick and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it down again to that lowest Hell whence it had escap'd: So he did also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of that bloudy Propitiation to be made by his cruel death, for the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away that ugly stain of guilt which so miserably he had contracted by sin, and averting that curse and fury which infinite Justice had most dreadfully thunder'd out upon him, if not stopt by the powerful
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:204593:21"/> merit of such a Satisfaction; And did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore command him to make attonement for his Soul with those <hi>bloudy</hi> oblations, which <hi>both</hi> receiv'd the most prevailing value from their <hi>mystical union</hi> with the precious bloud of the holy <hi>Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world,</hi> and also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest the deepest sense of that stupendious love and mercy, which was to bring GOD himself thus, for the transgressions of his own Creatures, to be torn and mangled by such wicked hands as durst be embrued with his infinitely sacred gore; that very compassion which could not be detain'd from the poor beast when under the slaughtering knife, serving proportionably to redouble the horrour of that saddest Tragedy, which even the Author and fountain of Life was without all compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to endure. For by all the rules of argument we cannot but infer, that if ever these Sacrifices were ordain'd by GOD upon such a mysterious design, as no Humane Reason could be able to have fal'n upon, such as was now mentioned, of typifying that great Oblation whereby
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:204593:22"/> the Messiah was to offer up himself for the sins of the World, and of being till <hi>then</hi> the great and only means of expiation upon that account; then surely they were never at all of any other Invention and contrivance but his alone: And especially when otherwise it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the verge of the most ingenious fancy to give any tollerable ground from which they could have taken birth; but on the contrary, the generous and tender nature of reasonable Beeings seems to shrink and contract it self at the very apprehension of acting the least violence upon the life of any thing, that were but so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to it, as to breath the same common air which refreshes its own lungs; and far less could it imagine that such wanton cruelties could be any suitable method for procuring that mercy in its own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, which in that of another (not so much inferiour to it, as it was to its Maker) it had so hugely invaded; or that the infinite GOD could relish any pleasure in those savage butcheries from which its relucting self was so very much
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:204593:22"/> averse, and whose unprovocked ferity it could not but greatly detest and abhor. And therefore had not GOD expressly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd such expiations unto <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity, they could not justly have expected any other return to the devotest of them they could venture upon, than that in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> (chap. 1. vers. 11. to 15.) <hi>To what purpose is the multitude of your sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to me? I delight not in the bloud of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats; bring no more vain oblations, which are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto me: when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of bloud.</hi> It was enough then to intimate unto us that <hi>Abel</hi>'s Offering was a peice of <hi>positive</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to tell us that GOD did testifie his respect unto it; especially in so compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious an History of such ancient Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions: it being highly rational to think he had never accepted any thing so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper in it self, and so unworthy of him, if it had not for such excellent reasons, as those above express'd, been elevated from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:204593:23"/> being <hi>either,</hi> by his own appointment and prescription. And so neither <hi>Adam,</hi> nor his Children were left to their own choice, or arbitrary inventions, how to acquit themselves unto that GOD, who more than once had dealt so bountifully and graciously with them.</p>

THAT divine Book does also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us how that after the Fall had knock'd off those chains which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd the Sensitive and animal Part within its due boundiaries and confines, it so broke loose (in the most of men) upon the Supream and Spiritual, as by the vehemency of its voluptuous inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to divert it from any other project or design, but how to satisfie its highest luxuries and revels, and swill the beast with all the wantonest inordinacies cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption it self could wallow into; till at last the poor debauch'd Soul forgot it was made for any more noble or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous purpose, than thus to drudge and pimp unto its own usurping slave, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204593:23"/> became so far unmindful of its duty and interest with its God (whom it could never have reflected upon without more defecated and refin'd thoughts than those it was habituated unto), as never once to mind there was a GOD at all, except such as was of its own creating, and could best serve the turn of those course and fulsome pleasures whereinto it was most fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily plung'd and immerst.

BUT yet in the Institution of this Law, the infinite goodness of GOD prevail'd with him to comply something with the unmalleable <hi>hardness of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heart (Matth. ch.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 8.). And therefore he did not only indulge them a Ceremonial Religion overspread with Types and Rites, they being so fondly addicted to these out of imitation of the Heathen customs, as that nothing almost could wean or turn their inclinations from them; and so did treat them like Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and teach them the loftiest Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their Salvation with gawdy and little Poppet-like things which could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:204593:29"/> their senses, <hi>the weak and beggerly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this world (Galat. ch.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 9.): but also, because of their being so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably entangled with almost insatiable lustings after the Onions and Flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he did allure and encourage them unto the observance of his Precepts and Statutes with the hugely <hi>outvying</hi> afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, and all the most exquisite and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing blessings and comforts that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent transitory life could desire. And such was the untoward and disingenuous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of most of their Race as wildly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert that so merciful condescention from its principal and main design, by making it serve to justle out and over-run the more <hi>essential</hi> and <hi>important,</hi> and so more <hi>bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> obligation <hi>of the weightier matters of the Law,</hi> those universal and native Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of sober and unforced Reason; as if the sensible Magnificence and Splendor of those Ritual &amp; External performances had been evidence enough that their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was mostly concerned in them, and that the flagrant smoak of Incense, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204593:29"/> reeking bloud of Goats did send up a more acceptable Savour into his Nostrils, than could the warmest Piety and Devotion that did only flame within the secret and unseen retirements of an immaterial Soul. Yea, they took occasion from it so to clog and load their hopes and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the heavy lumpish multitude of those express temporal promises, as to keep them still a gruntling upon that duller level upon which earthly Mortals love only to crawl, from winging it aloft to those more spiritual and sublimated joys which could only animate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to a proportionable Sanctity and Vertue. Such was their doating prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Superstition and Sensuality, as to suffer their thoughts to be hampered and born down, as well with the visible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and pomp of those outward Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, from looking over them unto the Truth and Substance at which they chiefly glanc'd; as with the grateful and fondest pleasures of their adored <hi>Canaan,</hi> from lifting up an eye above its Mountains unto those heavenly Regions of purest
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:204593:30"/> Glory, of which it was but the pledge and earnest.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore besides these fainter Adumbrations and Figures, they had <hi>a more sure word of prophecy:</hi> God having daily rais'd up some extraordinary and inspir'd Persons, both to preach unto them the true purport and notion of all that external and pompous Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so make it answer its <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Intendment, of setting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their look unto the final and design'd accomplishment of it, the Messiah; and also to foretell his coming with such pat and evident Prophesies of him, as could not let them be innocently ignorant of it, neither <hi>before,</hi> nor <hi>after</hi> it: that dawn still growing clearer and clearer the nearer this Sun of Righteousness was to rise in our World. And indeed they drew the liveliest strokes and lineaments of his Pourtracture with such palpable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, that the Evangelists themselves needed (as they ordinarly did) but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe from them to compile its History. So that justly might St. <hi>Peter (Acts</hi> chap.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:204593:30"/> 10. ver. 43.) say, <hi>To him give all the Prophets witness;</hi> and himself (<hi>Luke</hi> chap. 24. vers. 27.) <hi>beginning at</hi> Moses, <hi>and all the Prophets expound in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as 'tis hard to determine whether it be more of perverseness or infatuation that has kept off the progeny of that People from embracing him for their Messiah, in whom these many eminent and remarkable accomplishments of that whole cloud of Predictions, did even to a wonder most unanimously conspire; and that tho he had not been furnished with any other Credentials to attest him: so it is certain that whatever has been the cause of that, yet as they now <hi>do,</hi> so they always <hi>did</hi> look for a Messiah to come; however they might have mistaken in their fancies and opinions about him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And not only did they foretell his Person, but in a manner forestall part of his Office too; by retreiving the dignity and reputation of the Moral Law, the most vital and indispensable piece of their duty tho never so much Jews, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:204593:31"/> by their false glosses and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they had rob'd it of its greatest power and effect, and deprav'd and warped it unto their base and evil lives; or had postpon'd it unto those, tho more <hi>glittering,</hi> yet as much more <hi>unsignificant</hi> Usages and Rites, wherein they were so infinitely nice and plac'd the main of their Religion, and so did notice it no more but as a thing for which they might easily compensate GOD, in <hi>commuting</hi> by <hi>these</hi> for <hi>those</hi> other most <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> prescriptions of his Will. This is to be seen throughout all their Writings; and especially in, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. ver. 6. to 10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. ver. 8. to 23. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. ver. 16, 17. <hi>Isa.</hi> chap. 1. ver. 11. to 24. <hi>Jer.</hi> chap. 7. ver. 8. to 11. and 21. to 26. <hi>Hos.</hi> chap. 6. ver. 5, 6. <hi>Mic.</hi> chap. 6. ver. 6, 7, 8.</p>

Hence St. <hi>Peter</hi> (Epist. 1. chap. 1.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:204593:32"/> ver 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) speaking of that salvation of Souls, which is the end of the Christian Faith, says, <hi>Of which salvation the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you;</hi> (the <hi>Jews</hi> to wit) <hi>searching what, or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signifie, when it testified before hand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow; Ʋnto whom it was revealed, that not unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> (supposing that it was clearly enough revealed to them) <hi>but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you.</hi> 'Tis true our Saviour is said to have <hi>brought life and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to light through the Gospel,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10. But certainly that must be understood, not of an <hi>entire relucency,</hi> but only of a <hi>greater degree</hi> of that light: otherwise none before him had ever beheld even the faintest gleam or ray of its lustre; which is unquestionably false.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:204593:33"/> wont to be accustomed unto, and of which there was then no other probability but what could be gathered from the coming of the Messiah, which not a few presages made them hope was near at hand; it was no wonder, I say, they should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have then catcht at some favourable Scriptures accommodated to their more gross affections, wherewith to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves he was hastning to <hi>restore the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom again to Israel;</hi> and so that even his own Disciples, prepossest with the vulgar (and so course) expectations of his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Glory, should after all their converse with him, and his very Resurrection too, have question'd him whether or not he was then to do <hi>so,</hi> and never be resolv'd before the descent of the Holy Ghost, and his brightest Irradiations shone a more Heavenly Light upon their elevated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings. But that was only to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the seculency and mixture of their muddy inclinations, and the bad circumstances whereinto they were stated; and not to the dispensation of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:204593:33"/> GOD, which had condescended to all that was Reason, or Passion, or even Sense within them. Neither did it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that those of a more calcin'd and purified disposition might have had a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prospect than all the delicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigling satisfactions of any Sublunary and Material Region; and with just and devout <hi>Simeon</hi> (Luk: ch: 8: ver: 25:) <hi>waited for the true consolation of Israel:</hi> Nay, and with him (<hi>ver:</hi> 29: to 32.) been ready and content even to bid an eternal adieu to all the sweetest pleasures of this transient World upon the very first sight of his Salvation; which therefore could be nothing to be enjoy'd on this side the Grave. An evidence of this was also <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> his Song; <hi>Luke ch:</hi> 1: <hi>ver:</hi> 68: to 79. Altho then all the promises that were <hi>directly</hi> annext to that Legal Covenant whereinto God entered with that People at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> were but <hi>temporal,</hi> and such as only concern'd their outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity and comfort; yet that Law unto which they were engag'd, not being the <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>main</hi> of their duty, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204593:34"/> an Appendage to it, and an Umbrage of the Messiah, and those great Blessings and Priviledges which were to attend in his Retinue (as was shown, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.), so also were these Promises, not the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> and chief encouragements of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but <hi>peculiarly correspondent</hi> to their own Ceremonial Institution, and so only Pledges and Shadows of <hi>these</hi> other, as much more transcendent and ravishing than <hi>they,</hi> as is the Law <hi>these</hi> reward, more noble and accomplishing than That <hi>they</hi> belong'd to.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But that peoples stubborn and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most inflexible nature could not be easily prevail'd upon with those mild and softer enticements, nor their rugged Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on readily smooth'd into Vertue and true Holiness by the most sparkling proposals that related only to the enjoyments of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> life, and were not to be tasted in <hi>this,</hi> save at view and by Landskip. And so the generality of them, providing they could but keep their <hi>bodies</hi> as well as their <hi>desires</hi> under the shadow of their own Vines and Fig-trees, would neither court
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204593:34"/> nor thank any bounty for more that would but ensure them of so much. And thus, notwithstanding all the vastest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of any future bliss, they would never refrain the pursuit of those lusts and carnalities which would <hi>only</hi> indispose them for its <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>invisible</hi> fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but would whet and inflame them still the more for <hi>those</hi> which their grosser Senses could be capable to perceive. Therefore, that no method might be left unessayed how they could be wrought upon, and all that was even but sensible about them might be assaulted with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable operatives and movements; GOD in his infinite Mercy was pleas'd to tell them what his Justice would do, if they did frustrate the gentler strains of his Goodness, and incurr'd its vengeance and indignation; that so he might try if their Fears would drive them to that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which they were not so ingenuous as out of <hi>hope</hi> to perform. By his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets then he discovered unto them that <hi>Tophet ordained of old, the Pile whereof is Fire and much Wood, and the breath of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204593:35"/> Lord, like a stream of Brimstone, doth kindle it (Isai, ch.</hi> 30. <hi>ver.</hi> 33.): thus represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them that intollerably dreadful place which the workers of iniquity must resolve to be thrown head-long into, and where they are perpetually to be prey'd upon by the scorching flames of infinite wrath and revenge. And at this rate he pos'd the veriest desperate and daring sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whether or not his doating love to the most charming and gustful delights of wickedness, could furnish him with courage enough to face and out-brave Damnation, with a, <hi>Who among us shall dwell with devouring fire?

These dismal burnings whose neither <hi>degree</hi> nor <hi>duration</hi> admits of any other limits than <hi>those</hi> wherewith Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity it self is confin'd: and which therefore no gloss could make belong to any other Furnace than that of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless Pit.</p>

THUS we see how much profuse and liberal Heaven was of its Manifestations unto that people, and that it misst in nothing which could any wise conduce to point them out the road to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it self. So that well might GOD have argu'd the case with them as he did in <hi>Isaiah ch.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to 8. <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi> it being but a very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest expostulation after he had enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated those many even prodigalities of his care, in <hi>fencing it, and gathering out the stones thereof, and planting it with the chois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Vine, and building a Tower in the midst of it, and also making a Wine-press there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:</hi> All which were but so many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables and Allegories of what we have been discoursing. And how oft does he upbraid them with it by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> alone? Still telling them, when they hardned their neck, that <hi>since the day that their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers came forth out of Egypt unto that day,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:204593:36"/> (which was toward the end of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation) <hi>he had even sent unto them all his servants the Prophets, daily rising up early, and sending them: ch:</hi> 7: <hi>ver:</hi> 25: <hi>ch:</hi> 25: <hi>ver:</hi> 4. <hi>ch:</hi> 29: <hi>ver:</hi> 19: and <hi>ch:</hi> 32: <hi>ver:</hi> 33. So that there is nothing more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident than that, during that Period of the Church, there was most abundant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Will of GOD; having <hi>shewed thee, O man, what is good, and what did the Lord require of thee (Micah, ch:</hi> 6: <hi>ver:</hi> 8.): Nay, that there was knowledge enough even of the Messiah (<hi>Joh: ch:</hi> 5: <hi>ver:</hi> 39.), the whom to know was no less <hi>then,</hi> than <hi>yet is,</hi> life eternal.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And what need then of the Messiah, if all that belong'd to Life and Salvation was already made manifest to the World? Yes sure, the need of him was as great as ever. For the Jewish Manifestation being but in order to his appearance, it behov'd <hi>essentially</hi> to require that he should come, unless it self were to be made a Cheat and Imposture. And can it be imagin'd that a <hi>sufficient</hi> knowledge of his coming, and of the design of it, should have been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:204593:36"/> too to <hi>evacuate</hi> both? No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but on the contrary, the more <hi>clearly</hi> he was known to be coming, the more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably</hi> was he <hi>engag'd</hi> not to <hi>disappoint</hi> and <hi>bely</hi> that knowledge. Indeed if the Levitical Priesthood <hi>(under which the people received the Law)</hi> had not had an eye to that great High Priest of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, Christ Jesus, and so had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd all its perfection meerly from its Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Relation unto him, there had been no <hi>further need that another Priest should arise after the order of Melchisedeck, and not after the order of Aaron;</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle excellently well disputes it, <hi>Heb. ch:</hi> 7: <hi>ver:</hi> 11. But then, the sins of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Mankind having justly expos'd them to eternal wrath and condemnation, and so it having wholly surpast all within its own power and deservings (especially in that its guilty condition), to repair and attone them; GOD, in his new ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Salvation, had not exacted for them any full and condignly meritorious satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction unto that Justice which they had so vastly enrag'd and provocked: but had
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204593:37"/> out of his meer absolute Soveraignty and Dominion graciously vouchsaf'd his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Indemnity upon such <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements</hi> and <hi>formalities of Expiation,</hi> as went not beyond the Capacity of the Offender himself, even in his miserable and sinful estate, to <hi>make</hi> and <hi>perform.</hi> But, besides that this had been to suppress that Glory wherewith every one of the Divine Attributes shone so refulgently in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of our Redemption, and so had wholly defeated that design for which both We and the World we do inhabite, were first brought from our ancient no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>all things being for him,</hi> Heb: 2:10: His infinitely impartial Justice could not let it thus slip over; neither could any thing bribe it to the least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:204593:38"/> wherewith the Prophets were still <hi>refining</hi> and <hi>enforcing</hi> it; besides what Nature had irresistably suggested: all that He was to do as to that, being only to remove that rubbish of sinistruous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions wherewith wicked men might have almost smother'd it, and to make it appear again in its primitive and genuine Meaning and Lustre. Then secondly, let it be that the true <hi>intent</hi> and <hi>significancy</hi> of their Temple-ministration, and whole Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, was as little obvious and plain, as the Mysteries they represented were lofty and abstruse; yet every the least circumstance and punctilio of them was so very expressly prescrib'd, that even That could not have been more dark and perplexing, than This was evident and clear. And so their practice at least could never stand a hovering for want of <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> direction and enjoynment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But since the Messiah was the Salt which seasoned all their Sacrifices, and the Altar which sanctified their Gifts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they had <hi>as</hi> sufficiently known him too, all their Moral and Ceremonial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:204593:39"/> could not have advantag'd them any thing at all. And therefore, altho all the Types and Prophecies, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd them of his coming, should not have particularly condescended to describe the several Features and Traits of his Countenance, or give any minut account of what was afterwards known of him, when he <hi>was made manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preacht unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up into glory:</hi> yet if they gave <hi>sufficient</hi> (however <hi>general</hi>) notice that he was to <hi>finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for iniquity, and to bring in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophesie, and to anoint the most holy; and to be Messiah the Prince, and to be cut off, but not for himself, and to confirm the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with many, and cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease</hi> (Dan. 9. v. 24. to 27); if, I say, they did but discover so much of him; then certainly their Faith was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly provided for, and their very Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence needed be no more. Yet in the fourth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:204593:39"/> place, tho they did all that, and much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, as was hinted in §. V. ¶. 2. and §. VI. ¶. 2. and as every body may see thro-out the whole tenor and scope of the Old Testament, and especially if he compare it with the New: yet if they be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely considered, but with respect to those brightest Manifestations which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when come to fulfil whatever they had presag'd or foretold, did make of himself; then they cannot but be said to be as dark and obscure, and as much to wrap up the Revelation of the Messiah in shades and ambiguities, as the beginning of this Section did represent them. <hi>For even that which was made glorious, had no glory in respect, by reason of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which excelleth,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.10. But these last two, that those Types and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies were so much <hi>sufficient,</hi> as to be <hi>enough</hi> for informing the Faith of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and fixing it upon the Messiah that was to come; and yet that <hi>comparatively</hi> to those evidences and notices Which were had of him after he was <hi>made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:204593:40"/> glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth,</hi> they, were but veil'd and mysterious; these I say, are no ways elashing or inconsistent with one another. For surely tho we have sufficient account given us of the Antichrist, and of the second appearing of our Saviour to judge the World, by such express Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions as Cavil it self could not elude; yet if we should but draw the parallel betwixt the <hi>actual completion</hi> of them, and themselves as they <hi>now are awaiting</hi> their <hi>appointed</hi> time; how infinitely should we find the <hi>latter</hi> manifestation to surpass the <hi>former,</hi> and so This to be proportionably dark and obscure in respect of That.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But lastly, all the Passages in the New Testament which seem to derogate from the dispensation that was under the Old, cannot be so much understood of the <hi>inequality of the Manifestation</hi> that was between them, especially as to what more generally related unto the Messiah (tho even that was very considerable); as of the <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>intrinsick excellency and perfection</hi> of them, <hi>as pertaining to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:204593:40"/> the Jewish Ministration having no aptitude nor tendency of its own meer self <hi>to make the comers thereunto perfect, or take away sins,</hi> but only the Christian, in which the <hi>bloud of Christ, who through the eternal spirit, offered himself without spot to God, doth purge the conscience from dead works to serve the living God;</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle states the case all along the 7, 8, 9. and 10. Chapters of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> For not only did all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles constantly prove and confirm even those historical Descriptions which they wrote of his Person and Office, by most uncontravertible authorities from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; but they did also demonstrate the necessity of his coming out of the very <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of that Ceremonial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution which prefigur'd him; by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it evident that for its <hi>own sake</hi> it could have no acceptance with God, tho it had because of its <hi>symbolical exhibition</hi> of his sufferings; and consequently that it <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> suppos'd his coming, since from <hi>that</hi> it borrowed all its value and propriety towards the end for which it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:204593:41"/> So that ordinarily they Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Affair with the Jews, did it <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and evinc'd what they taught concerning the Blessed Jesus out of their own Law and Prophets: thus far were they from looking upon <hi>either,</hi> as too my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious and obscure in the manifestation of the Messiah. And so the <hi>Mosaick</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution was as much accommodated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi> of that People (especially as comprehending the perpetual Succession of Prophesie which its Founder bequeathed to it) as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly it could have been, without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as powerful as even Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have irresistably wrought them unto happiness: But further than <hi>these</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it never made any great (because needless) advance.</p>

Then God raised up an horn of

For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his spotless Morning (tho clouded with the Swadlihg-cloaths of weeping Humanity) was introduc'd with the warbling Anthems of those Coelestial Larks, the transported Angels, which sung the most rapturous strains for joy of its arrival; and his humble Fore-noon was sparkled with those earlier resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies which could not but shine from his brightest (tho lurking) Divinity; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fully advanc'd to his clearer Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, he liberally diffus'd such glancing Rayes of <hi>saving</hi> Light, and such <hi>benign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> of the most kindly Heat and warmth, over all the Nations of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Earth, as <hi>groping</hi> and <hi>benum'd</hi> Mortals had never <hi>seen</hi> nor <hi>felt</hi> before, and as was abundantly <hi>sufficient</hi> to <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>enliven</hi> them in mounting unto that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Region whence himself came.</p>

Assuredly we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine that he wanted any qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proper for such a performance; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that himself was not sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in all the Intigrues and Secrets of his Commission, or yet was not endued with Honesty enough to be faithful in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:204593:43"/> execution and delivery of it. For not only having lodg'd eternally in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of GOD (<hi>Joh. ch.</hi> 1: <hi>ver:</hi> 18.), and having <hi>been sent from God, from whom he received not the Spirit by measure (Joh. ch.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 34.), but having been GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (<hi>Joh: ch:</hi> 1: <hi>ver:</hi> 1:), he could not possibly fall under the imputation of <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> without a blasphemy much more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, than desperate, tho infinitely so; the Wisdom and Veracity and Fidelity of GOD being never to be challeng'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own self be first spurn'd off and rejected. So that if it be but once grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that he was the true Redeemer of the World, it must also be confest that <hi>the Apostle and High Priest of our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Christ Jesus, was faithful to him that had appointed him, as also</hi> Moses <hi>was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all his house: For this man was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy of more glory than</hi> Moses, <hi>in as much as he who hath builded the house, hath more honour than the house, for every house is builded by some man, but he that built all things is God</hi> (arguing from the Deity of Christ, which he most palpably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses):
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:204593:44"/>
                  <hi>and</hi> Moses <hi>verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of these things which were to be spoken after; but Christ as a Son over his own house, whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence, and the rejoycing of the hope firm unto the end.</hi> Heb. ch. 3. ver. 1. to 6.</p>

But having laid down his life, as well in <hi>Attestation,</hi> as to be the great <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of his Doctrine; he gave the most solemn and undenyable proof of the truth and perfection of it, By his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Resurrection from the dead, by which he was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness</hi> (Rom. ch. 1. ver. 4.); By his fourty days visible converse with his Disciples, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others of his followers, shewing them by his Hands, and Feet, and hollow Side, what mighty Spoils and Trophies he had carried over Death and the Grave, and by many most <hi>infallible proofs</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, that he was certainly alive again, and that it was he himself indeed, and no fleshless spirit or phantasm that entertain'd

And thus we have the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht and generous Religion, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the most Sacred and Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and confirm'd by the most uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible and prodigious Miracles, that ever the World did, or shall see.</p>

And it is as true that the design they were to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout was the most high and transcendent, that ever could have been taken up by any thing that was no more but mortal. Let us but cast a transient look upon what they were to perform; that so we may the better cognosce upon their abilities and endowments as they bore any corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency unto the event which was to arise from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That then which they were to do was, to preach CHRIST JESUS unto the World. Now this Jesus went under the repute of being no more but an obscure and mean Tradesman, the Son of a poor Carpenter, and so destitute of all things here away, as even by his own confession not to have so much as a Stone upon which to lay his Head. But what did he assert himself to be? No less than such as to renounce his <hi>suppos'd</hi> for his <hi>natural</hi> Father, and claim such a consanguinity with him who is Eternal, as at once to be himself and his begotten Son too; to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:204593:48"/> be consubstantial with GOD the Father, and yet a Person of his own self really <hi>proceeding</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> from him; and so equally as much the Deity as He was, tho nothing less than that same Person which was He. Yet he did not deny but that he was Man also: having likewise averr'd that he had, to his Divine, assum'd an Humane Nature; and so linked them together, as that altho there could not be any two substances more different from one another than these were, yet he had made them at that rate to coalesce and unite into one Individual Subsistence and Person, that the result of both might pass most properly under the denomination, either of GOD, or Man. And therefore he affirm'd that his Mother did lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of her Virginity by her having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him; she never having known any Man, but been impregnate by the generative Influence of the Holy Ghost, and overshadowed by the Power of the Most High: so that without ceasing still to be Maiden, she became the Mother of him, who made her own self, and was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204593:49"/> GOD equally uncapable of any <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>end</hi> to his Beeing and Existence.</p>

And having thus own'd such an as much <hi>mysterious,</hi> as <hi>infinite</hi> Dignity; he took it for no presumption to make use of all the as boundless Prerogatives conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent unto it. Wherefore he commanded the World to Worship and Adore him; to believe these most lofty and hidden Mysteries anent himself, which all the Reason it was ever accomplished withall, would sooner burst asunder and crack in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pieces, than stretch far enough to comprehend: and to obey such strict and severe Laws, as Flesh and Blood cannot bear, and seem rather to have been calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for governing the most sublime and unbodied Spirits that inhabite the Regions above; than those frail and sensual Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, who dwell in houses of Clay, and must first shake off these, before they can be wholly disentangled from those Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Passions and Desires, which constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhale out of their Terrene and Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Composition, and against which all those pure and elevated Enjoynments do mainly bend their rigor and checking
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:204593:49"/> force. And so he did oblige all Men, both to humble and subject their very Reason and Judgment unto his mere Say-So and peremptory averment; and also to be ordered in their most touching and important concerns according to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del which he had prescrib'd them, and confin'd in all their Actions, nay and most secret and whispering thoughts too, within the narrow limitations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints, which he had pleas'd to put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most prevalent and enticing incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of their present frame and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; yea moreover, that they should be always ready to forsake Houses, and Brethren, and Sisters, and Fathers, and Mothers, and Wives, and Children, and Lands, and even deny themselves, and lose their very lives, for his Names sake. And thereupon he promised to every one who would become his Disciple, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and perform whatsoever he commanded, nothing in this World, save a bare provision of necessaries at most, attended with Afflictions, and Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Contempt, and all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages

But on the other hand, he did threaten all those who should reject or rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, with the most dreadful and intollerable miseries and tortures, <hi>the gnawing worm that never dies,</hi> and <hi>the sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurious fire that never can be extinguished,</hi> which his provoked and avenging fury would certainly let loose upon them. And therefore he assur'd the World that he would appoint a folemn Day of final Doom, wherein he should be reveal'd from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming Fire, to raise the Dead from their Graves by the sound of his Trumpet; and to summond <hi>them</hi> and the <hi>quick</hi> together from all the corners of the extended Earth, to appear before his terrible Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal; and there receive Sentence, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man according to his Works, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad: and so that he would then take vengeance on them that had

Verily there is here such a combination of strange and lofty circumstances to enhanse the design of converting the World unto the belief of him who was so closly environed with them, as any body might think would have been too much to have dampt and confounded the most assured confidence, as well, as the most exalted accomplishments, in the very remotest aims to engage into it.</p>

BUT GOD who <hi>brought light out of darkness,</hi> knew also how to <hi>make the foolish and weak things of the world to confound the wise, and those that are mighty; and the base, and despis'd, yea, and those which are not, to bring to nought things that are</hi> (1 Cor. ch. 1. ver. 27, 28): and even in that to evidence, <hi>that the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness of God is wiser than men, and his weakness stronger than they.</hi> (ver. 25); and that upon a twofold account: The
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:204593:54"/> first, that <hi>no flesh should glory in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, but that he that glorieth should glory in the Lord</hi> (ver. 29, 31.); Since none could ascribe to himself the least share of the praise, who could not pretend to have contributed any thing at all of his own in the Purchase of the Conquest. And the second is intimated in that, <hi>the Preaching of the Cross is to them that perish, foolishness; but unto them that are saved, it is the power of God</hi> (ver. 18.); or that, tho GOD so order'd it, as that by the Rules of Carnal Reason there might not appear any thing more ridiculous, than to attempt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the whole World unto such a strange Doctrine as that of the Cross, by such a despicable handful of poor unbred and forlorn Trades-men; yet in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it should be made manifest that he had chosen the most admirable method that could have been thought upon for the compassing of his design, in having made use of such Instruments, as no sober or unprejudicate man could ever imagine to be working on their own accord, or mov'd, Automaton-like, by no higher
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:204593:55"/> Principle than their own Springs and Wheels. For there being such a vast dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion betwixt <hi>them</hi> and the <hi>effect</hi> that they were producing, as could not but have infinitely dishearten'd and dampt them from ever having made the very slightest essay toward it, and much more have uncapacitate them for bringing it to such a pass; who could ever think but that they were acted and assisted by some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent and invisible Power, which could only be able to carry through such an uncommon endeavour, and behov'd to be something hugely above Man, when it effectuat that which had nothing of him at all in it? So that without comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either to the demand of the <hi>Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a sign</hi> or <hi>of the Greeks seeking after wisdom, Christ crucified is unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, the power, and the wisdom of God</hi> (ver. 22.23, 24.); or without any other Prodigie from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but that one, which resulted from <hi>the foolishness of Preaching,</hi> the converting the World by those few contemptible and unlearned Apostles; and without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:204593:55"/> deep speculations of Wisdom, than what really shin'd in the wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of it, its very self (absolutely considered) was Miracle and Reason e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to attest and demonstrate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity from whence it came, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Authority with which it was invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But all this proceeds upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of an entire disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that Cause and Effect upon all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects; the only Miracle of This emerging from the suppos'd unaptitude of That, and so supposing that there was none pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or unto its self to forestal it: whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is enough, if either the Effect was in its own self a miracle, or suppos'd such a proportion (and consequently miracle) in the Cause as made it none; since still a real and unquestionable Miracle (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken for one single one, or a whole cluster and series of them) is sufficient for the production of that effect, which on any account whatsoever can have no more it self to recommend it, than that it is a Miracle. And so the Argument runs
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:204593:56"/> thus, Either the Apostles were abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified, and furnisht with sufficient Credentials to gain them credite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and convert the World unto the Faith of CHRIST; or they were not: if this latter, then they produc'd an Effect above the proportion of the Cause, and therefore a Miracle; if the former, then the Effect was not a Miracle indeed, but the Cause behov'd to be one; because such an Effect must either be a Miracle it self, or flow from what was <hi>so;</hi> when all that's meer Nature stands as impotent in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as did the Magicians in that of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and palpably acknowledges it to be <hi>the finger of God.</hi> But because such a Miracle as that of the Effect would have only inferr'd the exertion of GOD's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power immediatly in its production, without any elevation of the Cause, or operation according to the exigence of it; and consequently had inevitably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated the Effect it self, or immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produc'd all the several consents of those who had embrac'd the Gospel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any determination of their own
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:204593:56"/> minds upon the account of any rational perswasives or inducements; and so had quite overturn'd his design of being glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by their <hi>free</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Obedience: Therefore it was only consonant to his Wisdom and Providence that all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle should fall upon the Cause; and the Effect be no more <hi>so,</hi> but meerly upon a <hi>moral</hi> consideration; to wit, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what sway and prevalency violent lusts and passions has over the Souls and Judgements of men, it should be mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strange and wonderful that so many of These should gain the Field over the commonly victorious Forces of Those. But this does indeed serve only to argue and discover the miraculous efficiency of the successful Cause; when thus it does produce such conviction, as even so many Souls, biast with the load of Flesh, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not resist. Whatever then were the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> qualifications and aids from Nature (which was altogether impertinent here, so that they had but so much of it as still to be men, which they could not want); yet certainly they wanted no requisite
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:204593:57"/> accomplishment nor assistance for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that Office and Delegacy which was committed unto them. So that the perswading the World to be but <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> (which I confess was not the least difficulty) was the best step they could make to influence it to be Relgious and Christian too; they being to propose nothing but such a manly and noble Doctrine upon such demonstrative and evident grounds, as being but sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh'd and considered, could not but put even Scepticism it self to the blush and defeat.</p>

THUS our Blessed Saviour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving selected and set apart such clean and untainted (tho <hi>earthen) vessels,</hi> to convey the Treasure of his Doctrine unto the World, that <hi>the excellency of the power might be of God, and not of them</hi> (2 Cor. ch. 4. ver. 7.): he bestows on them all such advantages and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as could best evidence the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his own <hi>finger</hi> with their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and in a more eminent degree sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies those wants and defects which their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204593:61"/> circumstances in this World did occasion. First then, he admitted them to the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his more intimate converse and fellowship, even <hi>from the baptism of</hi> John, when he first entered upon the publick exercise of his Mediation, <hi>unto the same day that he was taken up into Heaven, and a cloud received him out of their sight</hi> (Act ch. 1. ver. 22.): and so they both saw with their eyes all the most remarkable and material passages of his life here on earth, and all the miraculous and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary works that he did in confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Doctrine and Authority; and also heard with their own ears all those Heavenly Discourses whereby he made <hi>known unto them all things that himself had heard from his Father</hi> (Joh. ch. 15. ver. 15.), and <hi>gave them to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God</hi> (Luk. ch. 8. ver. 10.), especially after his Resurrection, when he <hi>spoke to them of the things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it</hi> (Act. ch. 1. ver. 3.). Now the most they were to do being <hi>to bear him witness, because they had been with him from the beginning</hi> (Joh. ch. 15. ver. 27.); or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:204593:62"/> to give information of what they had learned only by their senses, and tell the World what they had seen him do, and what they had heard him speak: then, providing they had but the vulgar share of those faculties, together with that of any ordinary memory to retain what these brought in, as 'twere lamentable folly to doubt that they had; nothing more could be desir'd upon any Physical consideration to qualifie and enable them for their employment, but only, <hi>so</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi> them of the one, and let them <hi>see</hi> the other; since they were thus to be the meer Channel of conveyance unto his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Miracles. Hence they constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provocked unto the immediate recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what they asserted, by their own eyes and ears, as the most uncontroleable Argument of their being sufficiently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to testifie and averr it: as <hi>Act. ch.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 38. to 42. and 2 <hi>Pet. ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17, 18. and 1 <hi>Joh. ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:204593:62"/> them; Therefore, Secondly, <hi>he sent them the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, to teach them all things, and bring all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their remembrance, whatsoever he had said unto them</hi> (Joh. ch. 14. ver. 26.), <hi>and sent them the Spirit of truth, to guide them in all truth</hi> (Joh. ch. 16. ver. 13.), <hi>and him to abide with them for</hi>

So that they were infallibly secur'd from all manner of ignorance, whether <hi>privative,</hi> which is the not knowing of a thing requisite to be known; or <hi>positive,</hi> which is errour, or the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing of a thing, and imagining it to be otherwise than really it is. And Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because they were not men of such Credite and Authority in the World as to deserve any Implicite Faith in what they did alleadge; and so tho by these two advantages they might indeed be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain themselves of what they said, yet could not transmit the like assurance of it unto others: Therefore he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto them the power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles at their pleasure, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Gifts and Indowments of the

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:204593:63"/> and by the most prevailing and forcible Arguments, drawn from the vastest love he bore them, from the example of his own self who was made their Lord and Master, and from the infinite reward they were to expect (<hi>Matth. ch.</hi> 10: <hi>ver.</hi> 16. to 42. <hi>Mark ch.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. to 13. <hi>Joh. ch.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. to 21.), he perswades them even <hi>to rejoice that they were counted worthy to suffer for his Name (Act. ch.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 41.) Nay, because, tho <hi>the spirit was willing, yet the flesh was weak</hi> (Matth. ch. 26. <hi>ver:</hi> 41.), and so there was a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of some greater strength than their own to support them under those heaviest pressures and afflictions; he improves their Natural by a Divine Fortitude, and makes <hi>his grace sufficient for them, and in their weakness perfects his own strength</hi> (2 Cor. ch. 12. ver. 9, 10.); thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them to undervalue whatever they could do who could only kill the body, and even to <hi>court</hi> and <hi>defie</hi> all that could be formidable and threatning to Humane Nature, and valiantly to triumph over the acutest rigours of those glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdoms
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:204593:64"/> which equally incens'd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd the very Executioners of them; <hi>it being given to them, in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his sake</hi> (Philip. ch. 1. ver. 28, 30.). For besides that any the least Pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Retraction would have done more to countermine and supplant their Cause, than could their most signal miracles to astruct and establish it; the being thus baffl'd from their pretences being the plain confession of their having play'd the cheat and imposture in the attempt of obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them upon the World: such a brave and undaunted constancy under the smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Engines the most obdurate and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Lictor could fasten upon them, could not but deeply work upon any ingenuous and considering man, and sensibly touch him with the thoughts of their behoving to be mightily ascertain'd of what they so firmly profest, as in the attestation of it thus to suffer their very lives be torn out with all the exquisite and subtile cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty that even Hell it self could inspire or suggest; and of their not advancing any

Thus were these blessed men qualified for that Embassy and Message wherewith their Lord did honour them. And verily he that would cavil at these their qualifications, and would not be fully satisfied with that Furniture and Retinue wherewith they were attended, but would further desire I know not what to make them a Train solemn enough for the Augustness of their Commission; he would but render it more than suspicious that he was resolv'd never to acquiesce in any at all; their being nothing more for invention it self to choose upon, since all that could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd for gaining them authority and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite is already summ'd up.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:204593:65"/> the simple pretence of the Relater himself. For in either of these cases it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd to have been judged only by those evidences which arose allanerly out of its own self; such as the consistency of its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts with one another, and <hi>that</hi> of the Whole with the common Principles of sober Reason. But these could never have proved it to be any thing but meerly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible at best; and had still left it, as to any matter of Fact, as much questionable as any of that nature could be; otherwise every handsomely contriv'd Romance would merit no less to be believ'd than the most authentick History that ever gain'd credite and repute in the World. And so, however much fools these had been who would have made the very remotest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt thus to obtrude such an affair upon mankind, yet they could not have been more so, than would all those who had suffered themselves, to be wheedled into any the least perswasion of it by them. But the Apostles of JESUS CHRIST knew well enough they needed not be driven to such gray-headed or stranger pretexts, as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204593:66"/> the broachers of those feign'd Religions which overspread the rest of Nations, were forced to resort unto. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first appearance they made was in a Place <hi>where,</hi> and at a Time <hi>when</hi> those things which they asserted were either ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to have been disprov'd and found out, or else they were never so. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to draw men into the belief of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of that man, whom many visible circumstances did seemingly disparage from claiming but the smallest advance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his mean and obscure relations, nay did on the contrary expose to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and derision of that whole Nation wherein he was born; and being only to use such Arguments and Inducements for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them into that belief, as depended entirely upon matters of Fact, upon Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles done, and palpable accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ancient Prophesies, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection made from the Grave; they urged <hi>these</hi> upon the very place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon those Matters were performed, and when they were so very fresh and recent, as that the whole then living Age could
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:204593:66"/> not but know them equally with those passages of their own lives, that were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, most <hi>remarkable,</hi> or most <hi>present</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. And therefore, as their only design and business was to gain people unto the truth of what they were Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the most clear and irresistable convictions that could possibly have wrought upon those, who had not yet arriv'd to any such prodigious pitch of madness and distraction, as at once to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Reason and their Interest even in Eternity both together; so had any the least circumstance of what they alleadged been no more but some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of their own for carrying on the Plot, it had been altogether impossible but that discovery should have been made of it, and themselves exploded as the most arrant deceivers that ever made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize to impose any cheat upon the World. Since all those whom they first accoasted with their Doctrine, were, upon moe accounts than one, mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to examine and search into it, with all the rigor and circumspection that any
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:204593:67"/> testimony could any wise fall under; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prompted, in defence of their having crucified him whom they held out to be the LORD of Glory, and the Saviour of Mankind, rather than to preserve their own veriest lives, to catch them but a tripping in any one lie or falshood. And if they could have been so, there was nothing more easie than for them to have done it; when those things which, could only be in debate, were said to have no less pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly been manifest, than is the Sun in the Heavens when with triumphant splendor he shines most radiantly there; the very Eclipse of that Sun, when no revolution in Nature could have made him suffer the like darkness, being one of them. So that he who would have then called them into question would have been sure of this answer (<hi>Luk. ch.</hi> 24. <hi>ver</hi> 18.) <hi>Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in those days?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true that the great stress upon which they laid the truth of what they Preacht concerning their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:204593:67"/> Lord and Master, was his having <hi>risen again from the dead.</hi> Since, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all those other Credentials which did give witness of him, yet if he had altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther succumb'd unto the powers of the Grave, and his Dust had with that of the rest of his Brethren returned to dust a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and so he had undergone the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fate which uses to befall the whole race of frail and sinful Mankind; the most that could have been thought of him would have been but that which his very Disciples did say, <hi>Luk. ch.</hi> 24. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>We trusted that it should have been he, which should have redeemed Israel;</hi> insinuating as much as if all those promising hopes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they assured themselves of that great Salvation to be purchased by JESUS of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> had met with an entire disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, in so far as he was then dead and buried; and that even altho they profess'd (<hi>ver.</hi> 14.) that <hi>he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet mighty in Deed and Word before God and all the people.</hi> Wherefore CHRIST JESUS himself did before hand make his chiefest appeal to his being to rise again
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:204593:68"/> the third day (<hi>Matth. ch.</hi> 12. <hi>ver:</hi> 39, 40. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Joh. ch.</hi> 2.19.) And all his Apostles referr'd to his having done so, as the most irrefragable evidence and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the verity of that Religion which owns and adores him; <hi>Act.</hi> 2. from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. to 36, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet nevertheless that Resurrection was the only thing of all that related to him which seem'd to admit of the greatest scruples and difficulties; He having only appear'd after that unto those who were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons then mainly interessed in his so triumphing over, both His, and their Enemies, by whom He, and they also upon his account, were made the very Sarcasm and Drollery of the whole Age wherein they liv'd. And so it might have afforded matter enough for jealousie and suspition anent the truth of that affair, that it was only testified by those whom it so nearly concerned to have it believ'd to be true.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But (to wave at present all those considerations whereupon the Apostles cannot but be thought to have deserved the most unquestionable credit in all they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:204593:68"/> did aver) that JESUS CHRIST was to rise again from the Dead upon the third day after he had lyen among them, was so sufficiently attested by his own self while yet he was alive, that nothing but an evident and palpable demonstration of the Affirmative, that he still continued to make up their number after such a prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time was over, could be enough to countervail and invalidate that Testimony whereby he foretold that he would do so. For even before he laid down his life, the <hi>Works that he did,</hi> and <hi>the Scriptures which he fulfil'd,</hi> gave clear enough evidence that <hi>he was sent from the Father</hi> (Joh. 5. ver. 36, 39, 45, 46.); and so was infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falible in whatever he asserted. And therefore unless something as uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible, as were these Credentials which did vouch him, had positively been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to overturn them (which, supposing they were no less certain than they were, is quite impossible but to be imagin'd, when otherwise there would have been evident proof for both the extreams of the same contradiction); there was nothing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:204593:69"/> which he did say, but what was, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially at least, as much manifest and conspicuous, as it was that he was the true Messiah and Saviour of the World, and so as were those signal attestations which irrefragably did demonstrate him to be so. So that, altho he had never been seen again of any after his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion, yet, except it had been made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that, after the third day, whereon himself prophesied he was to rise, his Body was still a lifeless Carcass corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Grave, it would have been no less evident at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (where so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly he had made the Prediction) that after such a time he was risen again, than it was at his death that <hi>Truly he was the Son of God,</hi> when even those very Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that guarded at the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, were through their exceeding fears because of those Prodigies which did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at it, even forced to confess so much. Hence it was that, even before the two Disciples which were going to <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus</hi> had known that they had seen Him, He did upbraid their <hi>foolishness,</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:204593:69"/> and <hi>slowness of heart to believe</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, when they did not so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>him they saw not,</hi> Luk. ch. 24. ver. 24, 25. Neither were the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ignorant of this, when for fear that they should not be able to vindicate what they had done, by showing his Body to be still in the Grave after the third day, and so proving him to have been but a deceiver, <hi>they went and made the Sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch,</hi> Matth. ch. 27. ver. 62. to the end. For they were sagacious enough to know that if they could not do so, <hi>the last error would be worse than the first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Now let us see how it fared with them. <hi>In the end of the Sabbath, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dawn towards the first day of the week, there was a great earthquake; for the Angel of the Lord descended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and for fear of him the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did shake, and became as dead men; and so Jesus rose again from the dead, as he had said. And some of the watch came into the City, and shewed unto the chief
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:204593:70"/> Priests all the things that were done; and when they were assembled with the Elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney unto the Souldiers, saying, say ye, his Disciples came by night, and stole him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way while we slept: so they took the money, and did as they were taught; and this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is commonly reported among the Jews untill this day,</hi> Matth. ch. 28. ver. 11. to 15. But, alas! what will not Malice and obstinacy do, rather than yield unto the truth? Yet how far short do they ordinarily come of all their aims and most anxious endeavours? And this, if ever in any instance, is altogether manifest here. For not only was the utmost care and solicitude to secure the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, that conscious jealousie could sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> baffled to such a rate, as had almost turn'd their Watchmen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that same condition from which they were set to prevent another to arise, <hi>they became as dead men;</hi> but even when they found that all their diligence and pains was but in vain, they betook themselves to such a pitiful shift for dissembling their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204593:70"/> convictions, and yet advancing that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, <hi>his Disciples will come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, he is risen from the dead,</hi> which they were so very zealous to have precluded (tho they had then entirely precluded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from alledging but the veriest sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of any thing like it), that there needed no more to betray the <hi>Ʋltimus conatus</hi> of a desperate cause, than for the chief Priests and Elders of a Nation to place their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in so dull and ridiculous a one as it, <hi>His Disciples stole him away while we slept;</hi> there being nothing in it to shew that it was the issue of such a grand Consult as it proceeded from, but that they were not bid say, that they stole him away while they were awake; since it was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough known by every body, that had been no less puzzling a task for them, than to have pilfer'd an hair out of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Beard. And that nothing could have been contriv'd more notoriously dull and ridiculous to elude the evidence of Christs Resurrection, than for those who were guarding his Sepulchre to say that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:204593:71"/> his Disciples took him away while they slept, is even palpable from this, that tho it had been true, and they had really done so, yet such lazy Sleepers were altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to have declar'd whether there was any theft committed at all, or if there was any who were the thieves. For how could they who were asleep come to the notice of either? Or if they knew it, wherefore would they suffer their own lives to run so far in jeopardy as calmly to lye snorting (but yet with an Eye peeping out below their Elbow, for they must have had that wherewith to see what was done), and let another be stoln but into the meer pretence of a Resurrection unto life again? when such a negligence in so important a trust, would undoubtedly have brought themselves to repeat his death whom they were keeping in the grave, without the least grain of hope ever to rise thereafter but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any such another pretence too; had not these who brib'd them to Lie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves guilty of the fault, suborn'd their Governour also for a remission unto it.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:204593:71"/> Or yet, if it fortun'd them to look up just as the Disciples were running away with the dead body of their Master, and so to behold them making their escape with their so much desired prey; wherefore did they not immediatly start to their feet, and send the <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>cry</hi> after them, that so that Carcass upon which so much was depending might have been recovered out of their nimble and cunning hands? So that if there was no other proof nor witness given that CHRISTS Body was stoln out of the Grave, while the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who were watching it were asleep, but the meer averment of the same Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themselves, there would never have any thing been less capable to be discredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the stoutest calumnies of its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, than was that which the Disciples said to the contrary: since before such a testimony could avail the <hi>Jews</hi> in any thing, those drowsie Centinels behov'd to make Answer unto the Questions that have been now propos'd. And how these who professed they were sleeping could have done so, let all the <hi>Jews</hi> in the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:204593:72"/> world be even themselves Judges. So far does <hi>Iniquity stop its own mouth:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all they could have said was, that when they fell asleep the stone was yet lying unremov'd upon the Sepulchre, and the Seal put upon it was entire, but when they awakened all was gone, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for them to attend but the as empty as hollow Grave; and how that was done they were as ignorant as those that slept. Now, considering what was made out in the foregoing Paragraph, could any man in reason ever be so much asleep too, as to dream, that thereby the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of JESUS CHRIST himself, who had foretold his own Resurrection (<hi>Matth. ch.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and <hi>ch.</hi> 27. <hi>ver.</hi> 23.), was sufficiently counterpois'd, and he not truly risen again from the dead: and especially when all the presumption imaginable lay on the other side, and it had been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than probable that in such circumstances none but his own self had conveyed himself away, even tho there had been nothing before hand to have render'd it credible, but the <hi>bare word</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:204593:72"/> assertion of him who was then so a-mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, without those equally <hi>manifest</hi> and <hi>irrefragable</hi> Credentials, whereby he was attested, to procure it the belief of all whose ears it should reach; since such an Event corresponding to such a Prediction of it, could not but have fully evinc'd the truth of both.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But further, what more impudent fiction could have been invented than for those Souldiers to have all fal'n asleep when so nearly concern'd to be in the most vigilant posture they ever were into; and that at the very nick of time which did chiefly require the utmost care of their duty? Were they so very prodigal of their lives as for a nod or two to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them unto the greatest hazard they were almost capable of? Or what Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy did so overtake all of them, that not any one could hold up his head, to watch over it, and these of his Fellows, who behov'd to take the nap? But where were they lying when such an irresistable drowsiness possest them? Did they not surround the Sepulchre, or at least keep
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:204593:73"/> closly by it? And how then could they be lull'd into so profound a sleep, as that none of them could be disturb'd in it by all the noise, which cannot but be suppos'd to have been inevitable, in rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling back the <hi>great stone</hi> from the door of the Sepulchre, and carrying away the Body that lay there? Assuredly there is no sober man in the world that could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially reflect how to make any tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable return unto these Interrogatories, but would pronounce his Verdict of that sleep wherewith the <hi>Jews</hi> did alleadge their Souldiers were overcome, with him who said, <hi>Credat Judeus Appella, haud ego.</hi> And since their chief Priests and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders assembled together to take counsel what to do in such a pinch and exigency, when some of the Watch had given them an account what had happened them; and nothing could offer it self to relieve them out of the difficulty wherein they saw themselves to be then so deeply plunged, but to unravel again the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of that Watch which they had set to secure the Sepulchre, by giving the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:204593:73"/> Money to feign that such an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal sleep had render'd them as useless there, as if they had not been sent there at all, that so there might still be room left them for that pretext against which these Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were appointed to take heed (for it was palpable to all the World that the Disciples could never have prevail'd by force over so great a strength, and so, if to take away the Body of their LORD, must of necessity have made their recourse to some other method, which could not but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, either not to have been there, or else as much emasculated as if it had not); they should have infinitely rather enjoyn'd those covetous villains, whom the stamp of their Money could mould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any form they pleas'd, to pretend that the Disciples had cunningly by some one Artifice or other got an Opiate or <hi>Lethe</hi> Potion conveyed unto them among their Meat or Drink, by whose stupifying ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue they were even immerst into that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest slumber, than that of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, without any such violent impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, they had fal'n into it; when there
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204593:74"/> had been ten thousand times much more probability for the <hi>one</hi> (tho even that could not have in the least been but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in so many approaches unto the very um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of any thing that was such), than for the <hi>other.</hi> But it seems that they were so hugely eager and busie to have them once asleep, that they forgot to consider how it was likely they could ever have come thither.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And now this very Story so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly supplanting its own self, the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of JESUS CHRIST could not but be as manifest too, as it did so; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the whole Plot and Intigrue was not only detected and quite laid open, but even daily exprobrated unto those who had contriv'd, or were not asham'd to own it; and that by those same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples against whom it was levelled. Nay, I make not the least peradventure but that it was more than surmis'd throughout all <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> what was the account the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers gave of their Commission, and how they were brought off from ingenuously publishing the real truth of the affair unto
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204593:74"/> the World; Not only because it looks not probable that such a pack of Rascals could have all of them had circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enough to be so very close unto the secret, as that not any one of the whole Caball but would alwayes be upon his peremptores, and so very cautious and warry, as never to divulge or blab out some one suspicious word of it at all: or that there could have been such an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Priests and Elders for advising how they should stave off the blow that then was like to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:204593:75"/> did smartly charge those Priests and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themselves with what they had done, in such a bold manner, as betokened no less than an appeal unto all the hearers whether it was true which they said or not. So that, tho such was the obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and perversness of that people, that <hi>they had ears and did not hear, and eyes and did not see;</hi> yet he who would call it in question, that there was <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>light</hi> enough for them to have exercised these Organs withal, must be as wilfully blind and deaf, as were they, when most wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly so.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yea it is moreover observable that notwithstanding all those stoutest allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherewith the Apostles were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly impeaching the <hi>Jews</hi> even to their faces; yet there was never any thing, save persecutions and afflictions, but so much as hinted at by them to prove the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Neither to this very hour have those stubborn remainders of them, who so sottishly persist in the Traditions of their Fathers, been ever able to say any more for themselves, than what they did, as to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:204593:75"/> CHRISTS having risen again the third day from the dead: Since all the matter of Fact, as it has been here represented, was <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>ever since,</hi> so very not our and publick, that, however impudent and malicious they were, yet they could never master so much of either, as to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden them enough for denying even the least Punctilio or Iotta of it. So that all along there has never been any thing else, than this flat and inconsistent alleadgeance, <hi>the Souldiers slept, and the Disciples stole him away,</hi> oppos'd, either by the first hatchers, or succeeding abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, unto what was perpetually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided unto them at first by the Apostles themselves, and afterwards by all the Christians of the following Ages. And therefore altho there had never been any further evidence of CHRISTS Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but what shone so conspicuously out of these circumstances, there was none then living at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> who behov'd not to be steel'd with as much obduracy and perversness against all the most powerful forces and assaults of Conviction as even
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:204593:76"/> desperate wickedness it self could furnish out, before they could be arm'd enough to resist <hi>what</hi> was so very apparent in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of that: and especially when these who made any clutter or bustle about the contrary, were no less, but infinitely more reasonably to be suspect of partiality in the affair, than were even those whom the latter end of the second Paragraph did seem to question on that head; since they had their Authority and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby to keep up among the people, and were otherwise to lose that <hi>esteem</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> of which they were so vastly fond, and to which it was not their custome to make any hover about sacrificing the dearest and most immediate importance, that would only concern them in reference to a life which was no more but of a future date; whereas these poor and despis'd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles could have no design imaginable of their own to prompt them upon such an enterprize, attended with such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent dangers, but the clear and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent assurance they had of the truth, and the depending consequent Eternity which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:204593:76"/> was to be dispens'd accordingly as that was embrac'd; as afterwards shall be somewhat more fully shewed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Indeed it is acknowledged that JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST did never shew himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any after his Resurrection, but unto his own, and those who believed in him, and did afterwards profess themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the followers of his Doctrine. But the reason of this we may learn from <hi>those</hi> which he gave wherefore he would not let the Scribes and Pharisees see a sign (<hi>Mat: ch:</hi> 12: <hi>ver:</hi> 38. to 42.) nor tell the <hi>Jews</hi> that he was the CHRIST (<hi>Luk. ch:</hi> 22: <hi>ver:</hi> 67.), nor would pray to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Legions of Angels to defond him against their insolent violence (<hi>Matth. ch.</hi> 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 53.), nor yet come down from the Cross when they highly provocked him to do so, as a Test of his being the Son of GOD, which themselves had pitcht upon, and in which they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to acquiesce (<hi>ch:</hi> 27: <hi>ver.</hi> 40, 42:). For he knew well enough that tho He had condescended to <hi>any</hi> or <hi>all</hi> of these, yet <hi>they would not have believed.</hi> So stiffly were
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:204593:77"/> they resolved to stand out against all manner of conviction. And the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn engagements to believe in him wherewith they endeavoured to get him comply with their demands, were only but meer trains and allurements to nooze him into such a trick as they had a mind to play with him (<hi>Mark ch.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12.). But especially we have the case about his Resurrection, wherefore after that he did not appear as publickly as he had wont to do before, resolved in that answer which Father <hi>Abraham</hi> gave to the rich Glutton, when asking of him that he would send <hi>Lazarus</hi> to testifie unto his five Brethren; <hi>They have</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets, let them hear them; and if they hear not them, neither will they be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded tho one rose from the dead,</hi> Luk. ch. 16. ver. 27. to the end. So that for CHRIST to have walkt abroad again as solemnly as the circumstances of his being then rais'd unto a new and glorious life did require, had been for him but to have made a needless Parade amidst his altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther irreconciliable enemies to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:204593:77"/> at all: Nay, rather to have expos'd himself for once more to be crucified by them; than to convince them of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice he had already suffered from their cruel hands, or prevail with them seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to repent for having been so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guilty of it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Besides, it could not have been so very consistent with the present design of his Providence toward Mankind, so close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have hedged and fenced it in with such irresistable Demonstrations of what he would have it perswaded of, as that there would have no way been left for it to escape upon any account whatsoever. For then it had been quite impossible for any not to have believ'd all that had been propos'd unto him: and so all would have been overturn'd that was laid down as a Principle to this Discourse in the last Paragraph of the first Section, and GOD must have settled some other method by which to have glorified himself by those Reasonable Faculties which he bestowed upon man, than any that could relate to his free and arbitrary obedience. Wherefore, as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:204593:78"/> he was never wanting to him in the <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> discovery of himself, &amp; those prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Will, by which he would have him to be governed, that being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessary for the accomplishing of his end; So he never us'd to afford him any other than what was <hi>but so;</hi> since that would have as much fail'd in the <hi>excess,</hi> as the former would in the <hi>defect.</hi> And this is something more than insinuated in those Expostulations which our blessed Saviour himself had with the <hi>Jews,</hi> when troubled and tempted with their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant desires, <hi>Matth. ch.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to 4. <hi>Luk. ch.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 54. to 57. and <hi>Matth. ch.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21. Now, out of what has been said in the foregoing Paragraphs the Resurrection of CHRIST was sufficiently enough made manifest throughout all <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> tho there had been no other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to assert it than what has already been produc'd. And so the Apostles began to Preach it, <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where,</hi> if their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony had been capable to have been convict of falshood, it could not have slunkt off without having most palpably
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:204593:78"/> felt what it was to be so. And this is the first Observation which was drawn from the Time and Place at which the Apostles Preaching took its beginning.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE other thing remarkable is, that the Apostles did, not only at first broach their Doctrine at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but also, even <hi>fill that City with it,</hi> or proselyte such numbers of its Inhabitants unto the Faith of CHRIST, that even all the corners of it were crouded with them. One of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Sermons brought in the plentiful Shoal of <hi>about three thousand souls</hi> (Act. chap. 2. v. 4.), and another <hi>about five thousand</hi> (chap 4. ver. 4.). <hi>And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women</hi> (ch. 5. ver. 15.). It was not many days before when that People did persecute JESUS of Nazareth even unto the cruellest death of the Cross, with such an eager hatred and malice, that (contrary to what uses to be the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the multitude in the case even of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:204593:79"/> the basest Malefactors) they had like to have broken out into a Tumult, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously hal'd him to <hi>Calvary</hi> themselves, when otherwise they were not able to wrest him out of their Governours hands unto that place of Execution, because after he had <hi>examined him, he could find no fault in him at all,</hi> and so used all the means he could to get him releas'd and delivered from them: <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23, 14, 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.6, 12. And tho it was much the instigation of their Priests and Elders that prevail'd upon them to be so very violent in the pursuit of their envy and spight, and they might have slakt and relented in that so soon as they had cool'd and come to themselves again; yet that prepossession which the Mosaical Law had got was so strongly rivetted in them, and they were natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such a stiff-necked and stubborn kind of Creatures in whatever they had the least kindness for, that those Boute-feu's and Incendiaries could have no very ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose task of it to work them into all the rancour and heat imaginable against one,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:204593:79"/> whom they represented to be only upon design of robbing them of their beloved <hi>Moses,</hi> and that Religion which he gave name to both together. So that the next difficulty to <hi>that</hi> which of old was in root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Fore-fathers any wise deeply in the perswasion of the sacredness of that Institution which <hi>Moses</hi> did communicate unto them (and it is known how almost invincibly great that was, tho there was all the power of Prodigies and Miracles that could have even been wisht to have overcome it), was to influence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves then to lay aside that tenacious Prejudice anent it, which for so long had been deriv'd upon them, and which they had imbib'd &amp; suckt in with the very first Milk that entertain'd them in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Besides, they were so affected with the strong imagination of those Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings and Lightnings and Earthquakes which usher'd in and confirm'd that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Religion they receiv'd from the Mount, that, as they expected that the Prophet who was coming to evacuate and cancel what <hi>Moses</hi> had been imployed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:204593:80"/> into, was to be greater than he; so they could hardly be brought but to dream that the method wherein He would do that, would be less august and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, than what before had reconcil'd so much veneration and deference unto him whom he was so vastly to surpass and transcend. Nay further, the pungent sense which then they had of their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and oppression under the insulting Tyranny of the <hi>Romans</hi> (who had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them to the sharpest Claws of their devouring Eagle), having made them to apply all those passages of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which seem'd to foretell the most glorious things of the Reign of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah (but which aim'd at those that were to be, either <hi>Spiritual</hi> in his <hi>first coming,</hi> or else <hi>Literal</hi> only in his <hi>second</hi>) so as best to sooth their present condition; they could not brook the thought of any other to be their so anxiously long'd for Messiah, but such a one as came attended with all the external Pomp and Grandeur which their flattering expectations did suggest, and who would have Legions
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:204593:80"/> and Armies enough to deliver them from all their Enemies, and enstate them again into all the Prosperity and Happiness that ever their abounding <hi>Canaan</hi> could have afforded them.</p>

So that one might as well attempt to perswade me of the reality and truth of all that ever <hi>Ovid</hi> or <hi>Esop</hi> did fable, as that such thousands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as even filled <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> it self, were brought over by the Apostles of JESUS CHRIST to believe in Him, without being fully convinc'd of the certainty of his Doctrine by that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional evidence of it, which was sufficient to prevail with any whom Passion and Interest had not entirely blinded and hood-winkt. And as for the matter of Fact, I shall doubt of that when I begin to do so of every thing that my own eyes has not seen; and I fear not to be blam'd by any man of sense, tho I do it not any sooner.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204593:82"/> what has been said in these two last Sections, that none living then at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> could in reason but be oblidg'd to yield up their assent unto it; yet all the rest of the World being no less concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it, than were they, and GOD still using all those possible means that might neither <hi>out-do,</hi> nor <hi>fall short</hi> of his design upon Mankind, the Apostles were sent out, both to confirm, and propagate all over the face of the earth, what of its own self was thus so manifest in one place of it. And indeed they did so affix their Seal to the truth of that Resurrection, and consequently of that Doctrine which he, of whom it was asserted, did command them to Preach, that, as the World had never understood any thing more noble and elevated than was <hi>this,</hi> so it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen nor perceived any Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or evidence in behalf of <hi>any,</hi> more convincing and rational, than what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to vouch and recommend <hi>that;</hi> unless what the Blessed JESUS himself, while publickly conversant among men, did produce, was such.

And this was signally eminent in these instances.</p>
               <p n="2">2. First, their Education and Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could not render them less obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be jealous'd or call'd in question as men of contrivance and design than did their Practice and manner of Behaviour in the Function of their Apostleship: So that if they were Cheats and Impostors, they were the most dexterous and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at it, that ever deserv'd to be brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Name; Since their Art did so imitate Nature, nay and even almost out-do it in an ingenuous candor and simplicity, that to distinguish, which was the One, and which the Other, has now for near these seventeen hundred years been the aims and study of those, who (if the <hi>French</hi> Proverb <hi>Il a d' Esprit parce qui'l a de Malice</hi> hold) were altogether
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:204593:83"/> adapted for such a Criticism and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet to as little purpose, as with great anxiety and desire. And indeed had they been instigated by any other movement than the meerest convictions of the truth, wherewith they were so fully possest, and their singular engagements unto him who had deign'd them the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it, <hi>when he past by the wise and learned of the world,</hi> together with the pressing interest of their own Souls Salvation; there was nothing but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fore-knowledge of events to come, for teaching them how to carry at such a rate, that none might be able to find the least ground upon which to tax them of what they were really guilty of, that could have been sufficient to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the Design and Plot of that Scene, which of all necessity behov'd to have been laid ere ever they had entered upon the Acting the very least part of it: when every the least circumstance of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose out of the former with such a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing in-connection, that none could more reasonably look upon it as any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:204593:84"/> crucified</hi> (speaking to their very faces in presence of a great multitude of them) <hi>both Lord and Christ,</hi> Act. ch. 2 ver. 23, 32, 36? But when the very ague and shaking of the Consternation and afright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was yet upon them, and they had been scattered and dispers'd every one to search out for some obscure and conceal'd place to skulk into, and hide himself from the overwhelming force of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of Malice which so furiously had then broke out upon their Master, and themselves because of his sake; was it not pretty like, that they should have either dar'd the confidence, or been gathered together, for watching an opportunity to clench away with that dead body which so many Halbards were encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing round about? And tho the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive were granted unto both, yet by what Rules of Argument were they induc'd to presume upon the drowsiness and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of these Souldiers, whom they could not but know would almost rather have catcht one of them hankering about that Sepulchre, which was committed to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:204593:85"/> their care, than even not run themselves the same Fate with him who was immur'd within it. But none can read the last <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and the first of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter enough, upon which to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate those, who talk so loudly of their having only carried on the Affair by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice and Deceit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for the manner in which they propos'd their Doctrine, it bated not an Ace of that ingenuity and avowedness which was so visible in their Actions. The Cross of CHRIST was the most oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious and despicable circumstance, that could possibly have been fancied to scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize every body at him, and that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which owed its main excellency unto his having suffered upon such an accursed Tree. And yet however harsh and grating a sound that string did send forth, they were still harping upon it, as that which was of the most melodious and heavenly Accent that ever was toucht among the sons of Men. Yea they even gloried in it, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> deprecates that he should
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:204593:85"/> ever glory in any thing else, <hi>God forbid, that I should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Gal. <hi>chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and <hi>he counts all things but dung in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison thereof:</hi> Phil. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver</hi> 8. and upon that score does strangely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value and set at nought all the boasted Wisdom and Philosophy of those <hi>Greeks</hi> that were the most renowned for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 1, and 2. Now had they themselves wove any such Fable, as Christianity is constructed to be, what ridiculous infatuation had possest them thus to have made the very <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of the whole contrivance, to be so contemptible and choaking a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that no design imaginable could have suggested it to any, unless it had been either to render himself as much the derision and mockery of all Mankind as it was possible for them to make him, or else to try how much their easie and supinest Credulity could be played tricks with and impos'd upon? Wherefore if they can be allowed but so much Wit and Prudence as is necessarily supposable
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:204593:86"/> for enabling them to carry on such a Scheme and Delusion, if it be to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Character; it is quite inevitable but they must be granted also such a share of both, as might have furnished them with circumspection enough to have avoided that fatallest Rock upon which all the Reason in the World could not but have presag'd their whole Design would undoubtedly be dasht into pieces. And so 'tis palpably manifest that it was none of their own choice or invention to preach, and insist so much upon that Cross, which did thus tend to blunder and discredit what otherwise would have, upon the account of those sublime moral Doctrines which it contain'd, been both plausible and taking too: but that there was a constraint and necessity laid upon them, a Wo denounc'd <hi>if they should not preach such a Gospel,</hi> 1 Cor. ch. 9. v. 16. so that <hi>they could not but speak the things which they had seen and heard,</hi> Acts ch. 4. v. 20. The like inference offers it self also from the little complyance they shew toward either the <hi>Jews</hi> or the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:204593:86"/> in matters of Worship as of Practice. Whereas those who had had a mind to set up a new Religion of their own, would certainly have betaken themselves to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s way of it, and fram'd their Model so as it might have yielded some considerable things to each of all the most prevalent Factions in World, thereby the less to displease <hi>any,</hi> and the more sutly to wheadle and engage <hi>all</hi> of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But the manner wherein the Apostles delivered their Doctrine was not more irreserved and impartial, than it was simple and unstudied. It has been a common observation that Impostors and Cheats have their Tale so con'd and premeditated that the very Strain and Ornaments wherewith they busk and dress it up, does still bewray something of the Craft and Artifice which lies under them: so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible is it for Dissimulation not to stumble or trip in its most elaborate tracings of the foot-steps and vestiges of Truth; and even when it emulates most to dog out that genuine and native sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity which shines still inseparably from
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:204593:87"/> This, it is readily enough dog'd out itself to its own Lodgings &amp; most secret apartments. But as for my own part I could venture the whole stress of the affair upon this issue, but for the most exact and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Inquisitor to discover unto me the very least Syllable or lotta in all the Apostles writings, that is not the natural off-spring and suggestion of Ingenuity and Candor, or that has but the remotest appearance of any thing like precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'dness or affectation; they being, in spight of all that malice it self dare even hint at, the purest obedience unto that Command, and most signal accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Promise, <hi>Take no thought how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak,</hi> Matth. chap. 10. ver. 19. And so by the Rule of Contraries it is evident, that what can never be challeng'd of such an individual concomitant and adjunct to fraud and cousenage, must be of a quite opposite <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>name</hi> too. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a kin to this was their never conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending to those fawning and sycophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:204593:87"/> expressions or blandishments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by those who are Cheats usually, nay and even necessarily become Parasites like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For <hi>they preached not themselves, but Christ Jesus their Lord, and themselves only their servants (to whom they preacht) for Jesus sake</hi> (2 Cor. ch. 4. ver. 5.); and therefore <hi>they renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to every mans conscience in the sight of God</hi> (ver. 2.) This is also fully proved all along from the tenth Chapters to the end of that same Epistle.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And to all this let it be added, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any Men in the World contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more to establish those fundamental principles of all Commerce and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in it, <hi>viz. Do as you would be done unto,</hi> (Luke ch. 6. ver. 31.), and <hi>Lie not one to another</hi> (Col. ch. 3. ver. 9.), than they did; having enforc'd them with such allurements on the one hand, and terrours on the other, as all humane Promises and Threatnings came no less
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:204593:88"/> infinitely short of, than of what Eternity does at once protrack and enhance. Now granting that for some hidden and sinister ends they had so zealously mancipated themselves unto all the fatigue and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series which attended their propagating the Gospel: yet can it be imagin'd that, either to take the Monopoly of Falshood and unhonest Dealing to themselves, they had prohibited both unto all others; or else had so severely interdicted them, the more cunningly to advance That whose very Hinges and Poles were rooted into their very Essence and Beeing, as if they themselves could not be suddenly suspect of either, when others were forbid the very faintest inclination toward any of them? But, besides that thus they had put themselves upon the lotch of being doubly guilty in a matter of the highest concernment, and so exterminated all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane converse as the greatest Plagues that ever broke out into it; when they had teach'd the World the most sutle and mischievous method to <hi>murther under trust</hi> that ever it had been acquainted with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:204593:88"/> before, and first to curry and toll on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body into the most implicite confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and belief that the fairest pretences could suborn, and then give him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal stab when thus he had denuded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of all his Armour and means of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: besides this, I say, they had in stead of supplanting <hi>others,</hi> helpt mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prompt them how to undermine <hi>their own selves;</hi> since the most obvious and natural Test that uses to offer it self unto those who are concern'd to examine the broachers of any novel Religion, is, whether or not they did exemplifie it by their lives and conversations, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe their Doctrine into their Practice; and so there would have been a twofold occasion (<hi>one</hi> by the common obligation of enquiring after the truth, and <hi>onother</hi> by the present consideration) exhibited unto them, for making all the diligent search and scrutiny into the reality of what they averr'd, that possibly they could, and the utmost endeavours to varnish and set off that wrinkled and rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Face (which was so expos'd to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:204593:89"/> and beguile) could not probably escape such a multiplied warriness and inspection. So that had there been any policy or design anent their medling with those Precepts they so much recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they had hugely mistaken in it, when they had done themselves a far better office to have let them alone; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when if they had contriv'd their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness handsomly enough, they could not have stood in need of them; and if they had not done <hi>so,</hi> and therefore they were thought requisite, there was then, in any prudent reflection, the least exigence for them at all, because the least for any thing that could sollicite such an Inquisition as they certainly would.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But when they were no less zealous to have all men so far to own their own Reasons and discerning Faculties, as to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vass every Doctrine that could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd unto them, with the outmost cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and advertency that their circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could morally allow, before they gave any ear unto it, and did admit it into their belief and perswasion; than they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:204593:89"/> were to have them prone and ready to entertain such thoughts of their own vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and faithfulness, as might suit those strictest commands of both, whereby they did so severely tye all other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; shall it be imagin'd too, that this was also done with the greater artifice to prevent suspition and jealousie? as if they could have thought, that when they had taken all the pains that they could, to get their injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions the most punctually obeyed, yet such a one, tho the fundamental to all the rest (for none can secure themselves of anothers obsequiousness to their will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be once sufficiently <hi>convinc'd</hi> of the obligation that subjects him unto it), would supplant its own self, and (because of a presumption that those who had so vehemently prescrib'd it, could not readily need to be treated with that circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which it did so rigorously enjoyn) would be interpreted such a piece of their Ingenuity, as deserved not to fall under any other notion, but that of a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ought not to be spoil'd.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Indeed he <hi>who came to call men out of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:204593:90"/> darkness into his marvellous light</hi> (Act. ch. 26. ver. 18. and 1 Pet. ch. 2. ver. 9.), <hi>And in whom was life, and the life was the light of men</hi> (Joh. ch. 1. v. 4.), and <hi>who was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world</hi> (ver. 9.), as being <hi>the light of the world, and he that followeth him shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life</hi> (ch. 8. ver. 12.), nay who was <hi>God blessed for ever</hi> (Rom. ch. 9. ver. 5.), <hi>who is light, and in whom is no darkness at all</hi> (1 Joh. ch. ver. 5.); Indeed it can never be imagin'd by any who does not wickedly shut his Eyes against that <hi>Light,</hi> that He, or the Religion of which he was both the <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>Founder,</hi> should not be able to abide the faint glimmerings of our frail and shallow Reason, but should stand in need of the thickest shadow of dull and lazy Ignorance to shroud himself under, and set off those course Wares (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that supposition) which he would not get vented in the open and Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. No, no. He who was Essential Reason himself, and the <hi>Father of our
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:204593:90"/> Spirits</hi> (Heb. chap. 12. ver. 9.) as much, as of our Bodies, could never aim at ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging us to believe any thing, but what was asserted with evidences and grounds proportionable to the wisdom of the Author whence it deriv'd its authority. And he better knew the nature of those reasonable Creatures which his own hands had formed, than to think of ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with them to yield their assents unto any such sublime and heavenly Doctrine, as was either so mysterious and lofty in it self, or so very contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the interests of Flesh and Blood, and those carnal Souls which are born down to the Earth with the heaviest load of Sin and Corruption, as was his; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out palpable and manifest convictions; and such irrefragable and <hi>infallible proofs</hi> (Acts ch. 1. v. 3.) and demonstrations, as might render it more tollerable and rational for them to deny, even almost their own very Beeings, than what was so manifestly attested and confirmed by him: when he could not but see, that, tho at his pleasure he might either infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:204593:91"/> and distract them, or yet annihilate and turn them back again to that eternal Chaos whence at first he drew them out; yet he could never at once preserve them in their right wits, and the due exercise of those faculties which he had bestowed upon them; and also make them admit of his Religion, without sufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perswade and recommend it. And therefore as often as he found his credit and testimony to be questioned, he had always recourse unto those Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Prodigies, which he wrought to gain him reputation and authority; and which were so very abundant for that end, that even those who could have the perversness and obduracy to resist the <hi>influence,</hi> could not yet command so much of either, as to be able to controvert the <hi>Beeing</hi> of them also (<hi>Joh.</hi> ch. 11. v. 47.). Thus he appeals to <hi>the works which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given him to finish; the same works that I do</hi> (said he <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 36.), <hi>bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</hi> Yea he joyns issue with his Hearers upon the account of these, and remits his whole
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:204593:91"/> Cause to be judged according to them; <hi>If I do not the works of my Father</hi> (spoke he <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 37.) <hi>believe me not. But if I do, tho ye believe not me, believe the works that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him</hi> (ver. 38.). And conformably did his holy Apostles and Messengers propagate his Gospel after his ascention into Heaven; still provoking to those rational evidences whereby their Authority was asserted; and therefore supposing that without these none could be obliged to afford them the very smallest grain of belief. And so lest any body should ever fancy that any Christian was blindly to give up his judgment in an implicite or groundless assent, it was made a part of his <hi>duty</hi> as much, as before it was his <hi>prudence,</hi> to <hi>search the Scriptures</hi> (Joh. chap. 5. ver. 39.), and <hi>prove all things, that he may hold fast that which is good</hi> (1 Thess. 5.21.), and <hi>not to believe every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God</hi> (1 Joh. chap. 4. ver. 1.) that so he might <hi>be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh him a reason of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:204593:92"/> hope that is in him</hi> (1 Pet. ch. 3. v. 15.). So that justly might the Apostle call the Christian Religion, a <hi>reasonable service</hi> (Rom. chap. 12. v. 1.); or such a Faith and Obedience, as was backt and environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all the enforcements and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of reason, for procuring it the <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> of all who should but come to the full and sufficient notice of it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I doubt me greatly if all those who lay the stoutest claims to the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Profession will deal at such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous rate, and either own the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Practick of this Doctrine; and who therefore cannot but be the men of all the World most lyable to be call'd in question. But how the Apostles of JESUS CHRIST upon the account of it should come to be <hi>so,</hi> is so very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, that let the suspicious World conjure up to themselves whatever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts and dreams and imaginations they please, out of those bottomless jealousies which their lusts, and only their lusts does suggest to them; yet they shall as soon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:204593:92"/> perswade me that <hi>Julius Cesar</hi> had no other design in all his ambitious Battels and Victories, whereby the whole World was like to have faln under the sway of his Scepter, but only the more certainly to render himself thereafter the most pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and abject Slave, that ever was tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon by the proudest foot of Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence it self; as they shall do, that the Apostles did so recommend it unto Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, not to embrace any Religion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, before once they had fully assur'd themselves of the infallible truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it, only the more cunningly to get them yield up their Judgments with a blind and credulous assent unto what they were making it their business to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. And thus on several accounts it is palpable in this Section how much the Apostles did comply with their above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned suitable advantages, as to that first Instance which was given.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE second shall be in those Miracles and stupendious Works which they did in confirmation of that Doctrine they were Preaching, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by GOD himself did visibly give testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his concurrence with them. And in these they were so very signal that they could hardly be said more to repeat the <hi>mighty Words,</hi> than the <hi>mighty Deeds,</hi> even of their Divine Master himself. That first effect of the descent of the Holy Ghost upon them, their <hi>speaking with other Tongues</hi> (Act. ch. 2. ver. 4. to 12.), was so manifest and undeniable an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; that he must be no less partial and disingenuous who in the least would snarl or cavil at it, than were those very <hi>Jews,</hi> who choos'd rather to attribute it even unto the Fumes and Vapours of <hi>new Wine</hi> (tho the last refuge they could possibly have betaken themselves unto, because beyond <hi>that</hi> nothing could have been imagin'd more palpably flatt and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:204593:93"/> ridiculous), than give glory to GOD, and suffer themselves to be overcome with such an evident Demonstration of his power and assistance. For what more wonderful and strange could have been produc'd, than that these rude and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate men, who had never been so much as initiated into the very first lispings and spellings of Learning, for ought that could be presum'd of them, should on a sudden so utter and express themselves in several discrepant Idioms and Languages, as that a vast <hi>multitude, made up of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Lybia, about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and Proselytes, Cretes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians, should hear them speak the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of God, every man in his own tongue, wherein he was born?</hi> And how great was the multitude which was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this, may be conjectur'd from such a parcel of it, as was thereby convinc'd of that truth, which thus in the very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semination
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:204593:94"/> was so convincingly attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And upon the back of this Miracle followed another not a whit inferior to it in any circumstance whatsoever; which was the healing of the lame man, who had been so from his mothers womb, and was known to have been so by the whole City, and was above fourty years old; and that not in a corner, but at the Gate of the Temple when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour of common Prayer made all the people to flock thither, and when they had come in such numbers, as (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the vulgar hatred that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where did prejudice all men against these Apostles, yet nevertheless) had five thousand to spare unto them (<hi>Act. ch.</hi> 3. and 4.). We know with what Apparatus <hi>Annas the High Priest, and Caiaphas, and John and Alexander, and as many as were of the Kindred of the High Priest,</hi> and so as were enemies to the Name of JESUS, who was lookt upon as the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the whole Tribe; were gathered together to cognosce upon that affair. And
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:204593:94"/> yet how pitifully they came off, tho no doubt they did employ their utmost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to find any the least matter whereupon to quarrel; is to be seen in <hi>Act. ch.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. to 22. For they saw so little likelihood that these, who <hi>were unlearned and ignorant men,</hi> could have so boldly defended themselves, and pleaded their own cause in the face of so solemn a Sanhedrim, and far less <hi>that by their own power or holiness they could have made that man to walk,</hi> that even they <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves marvelled.</hi> So that <hi>beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it;</hi> nay could not but confess, when most seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring what to do in such a juncture, <hi>that indeed a notable miracle had been done by them,</hi> and that it was <hi>manifest to all them that dwelt in Jerusalem, and</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they could not deny it.</hi> But because they found themselves in such a strait, that, either they must suppress such a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, or else own him who would sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press themselves; they did strictly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and threaten them, not to teach any
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:204593:95"/> more in the Name of Jesus.</hi> And yet <hi>finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done,</hi> they were forc'd <hi>to let them go.</hi> It were altogether super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to Comment any further upon the several considerations, which are to be found here so conducive to the present purpose in hand; since they are too much obvious (not to presume) that every Reader will discover them himself.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The fifth Chapter of that forecited Book does also give us an account of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exercise of that Power which was conferr'd upon them. What more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, than for a Man and his Wife even to be Thunder-struck, not with that terrible <hi>voice that breaketh down the state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cedars, that shaketh the Wilderness, and maketh the Hinds to calve;</hi> but with the meer rebuke and expostulation of a poor Fisher-man? <hi>So that great fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard these things</hi> (ver. 11.). Neither was there less manifestation of that uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable Power which waited upon him,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:204593:95"/> when he rais'd <hi>Tabitha</hi> to life again after he was dead, <hi>as it was known he did through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Joppa</hi> (ch. 9. ver. 38. to the end); than thus without any violent cause, but that which was invisible, to make those shrink down dead, who just before were in life and perfect health. But since to narrate all the particulars would have swell'd that Book to too intollerable a bulk; therefore in the general we are told, that <hi>by the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people, insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Peter passing by, might overshadow some of them:</hi> And that <hi>there came also a multitude out of the Cities round about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits, and they were healed every one.</hi> And yet tho <hi>the High Priest was filled with indignation, and called the Counsel together, and all the Senate of the children of Israel,</hi> to objur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and punish them for having so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grest their former commands, and slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:204593:96"/> all those utmost certifications and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces wherewith they strove to enforce them; and tho <hi>they were even cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them,</hi> when they saw that nothing else would do with them, but that the rather they preacht <hi>the resurrection of Jesus,</hi> and that God <hi>had enabled him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour,</hi> and that <hi>they, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Holy Ghost, were witnesses of these things;</hi> and so, tho they slipt no means unessayed how they might cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail and evacuate the influence of those miracles which was spreading so very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly: Yet we hear nothing at all of any juggle or trick that they could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach them withal, or detect in them; but only that <hi>they did beat the</hi> Workers <hi>of them,</hi> and so <hi>let them go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither was that eminent Power only confin'd within the Walls of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> alone; but extended as far as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bodies which it haunted could trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themselves; nay as far as could be any thing that could be brought from them; for <hi>God wrought special miracles by the hand
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:204593:96"/> of</hi> Paul, <hi>so that from his body were brought unto the sick, hand-kerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them</hi> (ch. 19. ver. 11, 12.). Thus it descended with <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>Samaria;</hi> and by vertue thereof <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits, crying with loud voices came out of many, and many taken with Palsies, and that were lame, were healed,</hi> chap. 3. ver. 7. But whoever traces along the Journeys of those indefatigable Men, in planting the Gospel through all the World, will never miss to find <hi>God bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Heb. ch. 2. v. 4. So that justly might the inference be, <hi>how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</hi> ver. 3.</p>

               <p>NOW let us add this last instance, of their Sufferings for the sake of that Doctrine, which nothing could deter or frighten them from avowing and pressing upon the World; and <hi>these</hi> as well <hi>active,</hi> as <hi>passive.</hi> What sedulous and unwearied industry and pains, what toil and labours and travels and watchings, what peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and perils, what an ambulatory kind of life, what necessitous and strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what inconvenient and uneasie, what vext and torn and miserable and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; how much hunger and thirst, how much cold and nakedness, how much contempt and opprobry and derision, how much hatred and spight and envy and malice; how many Prisons and Goals and Dungeons, how many whippings and bonds, how many hazards and dangers, how many hardships and persecutions and afflictions, nay, how many Crosses and Racks and Gibbets and Swords and Axes and Flames, and other Engines and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:204593:97"/> of hellish and wicked Cruelty, and so how many tortures and deaths, did they not undergo and sustain in their propagating that Faith, whose <hi>first</hi> Beeing it owed to a crucified Head, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not but be beholden for its <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> unto <hi>proportionable</hi> Members? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I see a poor Epicurean, whose very soul has always been steeped in the softest luxury and pleasures, even swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fainting after he has but read these eight Verses of the eleventh Chapter of the second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> from the twenty third to the thirty, wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> sends them the Catalogue of what himself alone had met with and endur'd. And yet with what heroick fortitude and magnanimity of spirit, with what cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and alacrity, yea and even ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and triumphing too, did they go through all these difficulties, and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all those severest rigours and inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? and that notwithstanding it was but of late that they had shewed themselves masters of so much courage as but to dare to appear within the very farthest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ken of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:204593:98"/> any thing that could annoy or hurt them, or even so much as but to face with any confidence the poorest Kitchine-maid that would accuse them of <hi>having been with Jesus of Nazareth.</hi> Mat. chap. 26. ver. 56, 71.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Certainly it must have either been some strangely powerful resolution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd by more than common induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that now on a sudden could thus work them up to the very contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream of their wonted temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution: or else some wonderful kind of foresight and providence, that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore instruct them to resemble the Coward, so very naturally, as the most faint and misgiving hearted Creature, that ever shrunk under the apprehensions of terror and fear, could not have really done it more; that so their boldness and fortitude might arise out of that former repute, of being the meerest dastards that Mankind was ever disgrac'd withall, which so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously they had acquir'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, like the Sun out of a Cloud, with the advantagious surprise of a greater
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:204593:98"/> brightness and lustre; and that the World might thereby be tempted to construct some extraordinary cause to have been the author of an effect that was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily so. And which of the two was really the thing, let him, who cannot breath but he must scruple whether his Lungs be in motion or not, make the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for none else, I am sure, will do it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The truth is there was hardly any greater Miracle among all they did to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the truth of that Religion which cost them so dear, than its having done so: since it undoubtedly went no less vastly beyond the utmost endeavours of meer Nature to animate and support them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a heavy burden of torments, as had crusht the stoutest <hi>Atlas</hi> himself, even into nothing, and more than that, if more had been possible; than it would have non-plust all its powers to made a Star drop from the Firmament, or Sable the Original One with darkness, without the interposition of some opacous Body, to intercept its most dazling and refulgent splendor from our looking eyes. And
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:204593:99"/> that even altho they had been assisted with all the common influences that use to flow from the fullest appearance of the truth of an affair: supposing that no more sublime aides of Divine Grace had su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perveen'd to strengthen and encourage them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if all had been but a cheat and forgery upon whose account these suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were undergone, then to what an infinite pitch had the Miracle been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanc't and aggravated. That not one amongst so many as bare testimony of CHRISTS Life and Doctrine, should have prov'd false to the rest, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Imposture; That all the Arts of Torment, all the rigorous cruelties and fiercest Persecutions, should not be able to force but one single confession out of any of them, or make their tongue to faulter in their mouth when they were uttering the lie; That amidst the hotest flames, and under the sharpest, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutest pains and agonies, the most lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and pitiful estate, never the least qualm should be seen to come over any
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:204593:99"/> of their hearts, nor his courage to fagg, nor himself to be dampt or agasted; but that with undaunted stiffness of Spirit, all of them (maugre all the tortures that could reach even the utmost capacity wherein mankind could be passive) they should be true and constant to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and endure any thing but the secret to be extorted out of them, or the mystery and confederacy to be unfolded, or get the smallest vent: That, I say, they should all of them have so behav'd in advancing a meer Trick and delusion, upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration whatsoever; can never be so much as <hi>imagin'd</hi> without a madness, next door to <hi>that</hi> which had prompted them even to <hi>do</hi> so.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And especially if on the other hand it be noticed that no less pains was taken upon them, with the most bewitching allurements and promises, and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuatory and enticing methods, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Riches, or Honours, or Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the only valuable engagements of this present World, could furnish matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. So that they could not be constructed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:204593:100"/> more to have imitated their Blessed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, as he was a Man of Sorrows and Sufferings, by taking up their Cross and following him; than as he despis'd the Devils <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that whole-sale prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of the whole World which he made him, by their generous contempt of all its most ravishing and smiling favours and blandishments. And yet the glittering shine of a few pieces of Silver could be so extreamly prevalent with one of twelve against the truth, as to bribe him unto a treachery so prodigiously odious, that nothing under that name can be render'd more so, than by branding it with That of him, who thereby made himself the very Proverb, and even Abstract of such a baseness and degeneracy: tho after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when he saw the mischief he had done had proceeded to a length whence he was not able to bring it back again and redress it, he choos'd rather even to end his lif with a Halter, than abide the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful noise of those horrours which the cry of innocent blood sounded constantly in his ears, or suffer the smartest pangs and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:204593:100"/> gnawings of the Remorse wherewith he was overtaken, because he had so impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously betray'd it. Wherefore that any Men could have been so in love with a Lie and their own Fable, as for its sake to have thus, not only endur'd the utmost Miseries and Tortures, and even Death it self; but also rejected and contemn'd whatever this flattering World could as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault them withall: is so infinitely unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable and stupendious, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer title of madness and frenzy, were but too gentle and smooth a reproach, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to besputter him, among whose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dreams it should get liberty to enter: since he hehov'd to be bereft of something else than his Wits, who could fancy that such a company of men, could be so, not only of theirs, but even of their Passions, and Senses too.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And as their Sufferings was the last Testimony they could give unto that Doctrine upon whose account they did undergo them, the laying down of their life (as all of them did, save St. <hi>John</hi> alone, who yet owed his preservation to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:204593:101"/> a Miracle, tho one of the greatest, yet not more so, than the cruelty which it did enervate and defeat) being one of them; So were they the last aggravating circumstance that voucht them to the World, and did preoccupy all manner of objection wherewith their authority, might be capable to be assaulted. For had all men been of <hi>Gallio</hi>'s temper, and <hi>cared for none of those things,</hi> there might perhaps have been some shadow of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in it, that during such an estate of indifferency about matters of Religion, the Apostles had at unawars surpriz'd the World with theirs, and <hi>sowed those tares</hi> (as the Infidel calls them) <hi>when the housholder and all his servants were asleep.</hi> But God out of his infinite condescention to Mankind, did no less effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against, than he clearly foresaw such a Cavil; having by his all-wise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence so order'd it, as that the Religion he was abetting, might not more be the Result of that Industry, than the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of those Sufferings, which those, whom he did imploy to advance it, did
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:204593:101"/> not grudge in the performance. And therefore the Apostles did no sooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the World upon the design, for which they were consecrated with so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Title; but, as if some savage Tygers had broke loose to devour the whole species of Humane Nature, there was none almost that own'd any claim un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, who did not quickly bestir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with all their power and might, totally to extirpate and suppress them. So that the noise of their attempt could be no more hastily spread abroad, than it as much alarm'd and put in commotion all the Courts of the whole astonished World, as before the birth of their Lord had done That of the quaking and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Herod;</hi> and it then became the task and business of every body, who could, either <hi>command,</hi> or <hi>weild</hi> the fatal Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Execution, furiously to set them a work upon those poor Apostles, against whom nothing was reputed too cruel, that could any wise be subservient unto the utmost spight and revenge wherewith they were so virulently persecuted. Thus
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:204593:102"/> was their first entertainment in the World. And yet maugre it all, they triumphantly went on with their affair; and the Cross of CHRIST became at last the top Jewel and decorement of those proudest Crowns, which had before so much appear'd in array against it.</p>

               <head>SECTION XX.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I Am not ignorant that a desperate Crew of brain-sick and giddy People, transported with the fanatick, or rather fantastick Enthusiasms of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken Zeal (not to give it any worse word, tho I am sure it deserves one), have of late afforded the wicked World something like an instance wherewith to confront and confute all that has been said as to this last Section. These indeed are a kind of Folks, so possest with <hi>I know not what</hi> busie Imagination, as not only crams their Heads with strangely delusive &amp; odd Chymaera's &amp; Fancies, not more worthy to be treated with all the ridicule and raillery imaginable, than they are blasphemous and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:204593:102"/> abominable of their own selves; but also fills their Hands with such despicable, tho barbarous Weapons of Cruelty, Syths, Pitch-forks, Spades, Flails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which nothing but madness and infatuation could have made them snatch up; and that to perpetrate the most odious Crimes of Rebellion, Regicide, Sacriledge, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ever came to such a height in any civilized, and far more any Christian Nation. So that they have become the utmost reproach and disgrace of ours, and of that holy, unblameable, and undefil'd Religion which we profess.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And yet these Men, if their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form can gain them the credit to be call'd such, there being nothing else in them to do it; even these, such as they are, have turn'd it customary to go to the Scaffold with such an insolent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedness, as if they went there, rather to act the part of some Mountebank or Bravado, than that of a Criminal, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor. And aping even a kind of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> fortitude and courage, they give up their necks to the Hangman (when for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:204593:103"/> once but to say <hi>GOD save the King,</hi> they could preserve them to be their own) with something of a mungrel grimace, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender'd betwixt grinning and smiling, which would be at insinuating as much to the Spectators, as if they even rejoyc'd thus to be put to death for their beloved and darling Opinions and Practices. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I think (with submission to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) that the only pertinent Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my wherewith their Veins could be let Blood of, were that of a Launcet; and that no kind of Hemp could be more properly applyed to any other place of them, than their Shoulders: a <hi>Bridewell</hi> or <hi>Bedlam</hi> being the far fittest punishment that they could be condemn'd unto. And these are they from whom some can have impudence enough to draw their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, against those, which the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Apostles do offer unto us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But which of the two, those who <hi>give,</hi> or those who <hi>take</hi> the occasion of them, are the most disingenuous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, these following disparities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Apostles and those Fanaticks
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:204593:103"/> (Oh! the comparison) shall determine: First then, tho the Apostles were of the meanest extract and education, yet were they men of fixt and solid Heads, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reasonable and vertuous; as those excellent Writings which they left behind them renders it palpable to any body of near the half of that sobriety and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which highly recommended them. But these light and wild extravagants, tho they are but the very dregs and feculency of Mankind, on the account of, either their <hi>birth,</hi> or <hi>breeding;</hi> yet they are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>so,</hi> because of their very souls and immoralities; as being such a herd of dull, and untractable, and whining, and debaucht Animals, as scarcely go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond those of the Hoggs and Goats, which ever any of them was only born for to attend.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Secondly, The Apostles did not precipitantly embark themselves into such a design, without sufficient foresight of what hazards and difficulties were to be its concomitants: but they were through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ascertain'd before-hand of what was
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:204593:104"/> awaiting them: so that not only the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings themselves in <hi>general,</hi> which they were to undergo, but the very manner and circumstances of severals of them in <hi>particular,</hi> were infallibly foretold them by him, whom in <hi>them</hi> they were to resemble; and they knew that they were so: as <hi>Matth. ch.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. to 39. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 24, 25. <hi>Luk. ch.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. to 33. <hi>Joh ch.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>ch.</hi> 21. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. But as for these desperado Whiggs, I doubt it shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they would be so ready to engage in their distraction, did they certainly foresee what would be the event of it: else why would they so skulk up and down, and lurk in such dark Caverns and Holes, as they think the most diligent search of the whole Kingdom shall never be able to find them out? Sure a method very much different from that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, who were seldome, if ever found to decline the very greatest hazard that could threaten them. Thus <hi>Act. ch.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to 21. the Angel of the Lord had no sooner releas'd them out of that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:204593:104"/> Prison, wherein they had been cast, to keep them unto the most severe trial that their no less <hi>powerful,</hi> than <hi>enraged</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could subject them unto; when <hi>they entered again into the Temple early in the next morning, and taught.</hi> Now these people having once launcht out into that Ocean of Vanity and Delusion, they are resolv'd in spight of all the boisterous and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering storms which can befall them, still to hold up something like a stiff and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yielding Sail, and brave it out to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uttermost. And that they should do so, is no great matter for wonder, if it be consider'd,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thirdly, that those things of which they are so very tenacious, are such, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are much more liable to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and impos'd upon, than were the Apostles to be in <hi>those</hi> wherefore they laid down their lives. Because all that they die for, is but the meer figment and opinion of their own distempered and raving Brains, the product of some fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> temper. Whereas the Apostles did sustain all their sufferings
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:204593:105"/> upon the account of what they affirm'd they had <hi>heard and seen.</hi> And every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows that, in this frail estate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Man lies now a-grovelling, there is not the ten thousand part of that hazard for his <hi>Outward</hi> Senses to be seduc'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by their proper Objects, that there is for his <hi>inward</hi> to be so by theirs. Let it now be suppos'd that they are really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and betrayed by their own heated Imaginations and Phancies (as I have the charity to think that they are, otherwise I behoved to look upon them as possest with something worse than meer mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or simple distraction, when as <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly</hi> as <hi>willingly</hi> they would so destroy themselves); then they cannot but be prompted to adhere unto those their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, by all the influence that a real Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion uses to have upon Men: and the Matter, wherein <hi>these</hi> happens to fall, being of the highest importance, and such as overpoizes the most valuable conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any thing on this side Eternity, they must by consequence undergo for them what ever <hi>that</hi> in the general does
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:204593:105"/> oblidge any to endure. But the Apostles, as they cannot be presum'd to have been cheated by their Senses, so neither can they be constructed any wise capable (mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally speaking) to have so held out unto the end, and persever'd in their constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, notwithstanding all that Cruelty it self could do to shake and brangle it, had they indeed been so. And therefore for them to have suffered so much for what they did testifie, was proportionably as much stronger an Argument in behalf of its being true, than any that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd from the Sufferings (I should have said Punishments), of these demented and pitiful Fanaticks, for their Dreams and Visions; as the certainty which Those deriv'd from their Senses did transcend what These borrow only from their meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Putaram</hi> and fanciful conjecture. And how much that was, they must be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether senseless, who do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But lastly, what is it that, either these, or any other Sect that ever was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cope of Heaven, have been try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:204593:106"/> with, that can come in competition with what the Apostles and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (whom interpretatively I take in with them, all along these two last Sections) did endure? Has their tortures been as violent, and as lasting too, as was theirs? Has their deaths been as cruel and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as were those which they went through? No surely. The most that all such use to be punisht withal, is but what the Laws of every Nation directs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the disturbers of its Peace and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: So that the worst was to be flung over a Ladder, or for ones neck to be ty'd to a Beam, and then have a Sledge driven out under him. And is this the first time that Melancholy has made men hang themselves? Or is that sufficient to draw the parallel with all that, which the first Paragraph of the last Section did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite to us anent the sufferings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles? And thus we see in these four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances (in all which, cumulatively taken, at least, I defie any man to give the exact similitude) how much they wrong and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach themselves, as well as the blessed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:204593:106"/> Apostles of JESUS CHRIST, who would rank Them and those <hi>sufferings</hi> which they under-went for the sake of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, together with such a despicable pack of infatuated Fanaticks, and those <hi>infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> which their obstinate crimes and folly does even extort from the slow hands of relucting Justice.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And now we have gone through those several respects whereupon the Apostles did most punctualy reduce unto their practice those advantages, which their Lord did bestow upon them, for peculiarly qualifying them to be such unto him; in so far, to wit, as they concern that credit and authority whereby they were to be reconcil'd to the repute and esteem of the World. And indeed I make not the least doubt, that, if the matter of Fact were once condescended upon, and if all that has been said, both as to what did vouch the Holy JESUS himself, and those his holy Apostles, were duely and seriously ponder'd and considered, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Christian Religion would so demonstratively appear, that the next
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:204593:107"/> Paradox we might expect from those who would then deny it, not only to be True, but even to be <hi>demonstratively</hi> so, could be no less than that the Mathematicks themselves knew never any thing that merited to go under that name. And the very event confirm'd this: it being quite impossible, that so many Millions and Myriads of Men, of all kinds of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and Interests, and Religions, and Learning, could have ever been prevail'd upon to embrace a new Religion, of such a constitution and circumstances, without something more clear and irradiant than the very Noon-days brightness, even to dazle them into a conviction of it; as the eleventh and twelfth Sections did before palpably make it to appear. So that if it had been the counsel and work of Man, it could not but have come to nought, as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> did rationally dispute it, <hi>Acts</hi> chap. 5. v. 38, 39. Thus <hi>their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world</hi> Rom. chap. 10. ver. 13. Thus <hi>they grounded and settled the Faith, and the hope of the Gospel, and preacht it to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:204593:107"/> every creature which is under heaven.</hi> Col. chap. 1. ver. 28.</p>

                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:204593:108"/> liv'd immortal in their consecrated succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts his beloved <hi>Timothy</hi> (2 epist. ch. 2. v. 2.), <hi>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also.</hi> And besides their having thus deriv'd the Christian Religion unto, and entail'd it upon such as might still preserve and keep it up in the World; they committed the most material and concerning part, if not the whole, of it unto Writing. Thus they left to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity an immediate and authentick account of the Life and Doctrine and Miracles of their great and blessed LORD and SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, even in a quadruple Record, to recommend it the more by the unanimous relation of so many Witnesses, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all possible defects or mistakes in the fuller and true Narrative of it. They wrote also the History of the Acts of the Apostles, and of the first progress and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Christianity from its native <hi>Jerusalem</hi> unto all the most considerable parts of the habitable earth. And seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:204593:108"/> of them, especially St. <hi>Paul,</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose most divine and inspir'd Epistles to <hi>explain</hi> and <hi>assert</hi> the Christian Faith, and vindicate it from those Heresies which were assaulting, or like to assault it. And last of all, the Divine St. <hi>John</hi> bequeath'd a Book of Revelation, to give the Church some hint of what it was to meet with in all its several Periods and Stages, and what was to come in the last dayes of the World, and <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>at</hi> the second ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the Son of Man. Thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully did they look to the propagation of that Holy Religion, upon which, not only their own, but the hopes of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were depending; and whereto they had devoted themselves, Souls, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and Interests, with the most exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant zeal and affectionate concernment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if they were so very faithful in relation to the Object, surely they were no less in reference to the Subject Matter of their Commission; since the one does necessarily follow the other: and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been at the pains to disseminate the Gospel unto all the Race of Mankind,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:204593:109"/> evidently infers the having also made a compleat and full delivery of whatever belonging to it was imparted unto them by CHRIST or his Holy Spirit. For to what purpose should they have been at so much toil and trouble that they might plant Christianity among men, if yet they had counteracted themselves by such a nigardly distribution of it, as had render'd that which they had dispens'd, ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and useless, by the want of some other things <hi>as considerable,</hi> which they had kept up and detain'd. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> professed that he had <hi>kept back</hi> nothing that was profitable for his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes (<hi>Act. ch.</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 20.): and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he takes them to <hi>record that he was pure from the blood of all men, for he had not shunned to declare unto them all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God</hi> (ver. 26, 27.); and yet once before he parts with them, he tells them, that he has <hi>shewed them all things,</hi> (ver. 35.). Nay so far was be from reserving any part of that Doctrine wherein the Salvation of any did consist, that he even stoopt unto all the mean and humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descentions
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:204593:109"/> imaginable, that he might thereby have occasion to insinuat and even screw it in into every body he could get but any wise accoasted; being <hi>made servant to all, that he might gain the more, and made all things to all men, that he might by all means save some.</hi> 1 Cor. chap. 9. ver. 19, to 22. Neither could any consideration whatsoever be able enough to damp or suborn him from freely expressing the mind of his Lord, even to the last Iotta of it, as <hi>being bold in God to speak his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel with much contention;</hi> and so <hi>he spoke it, not as pleasing men, but God, which try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearts, since he was allowed of him to be put in trust with it.</hi> 1 Thess. chap 2. ver. 2. to 6. So that, as himself sayes, (and <hi>he spoke the truth in Christ, and lied not), he was ordained to be a Preacher, and an Apostle, a Teacher among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in faith and verity.</hi> (1 Tim. chap. 2. ver. 7.) And so there is not the least shadow left us for doubting about the <hi>entireness</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of that faith, which the Apostles did communicate to the

For had they wrapt and folded up their Doctrine in any ambiguous or aenigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal terms, they might indeed have <hi>amus'd</hi> and <hi>perplext</hi> the world, but sure they had never done any thing to have <hi>better'd</hi> or <hi>improv'd</hi> it.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:204593:110"/> behold the glory of the Lord residing there. So that had they not clearly and openly reveal'd those Divine Truths which concern the Salvation of Mankind; they had but serv'd it at the same, if not worse rate, at which <hi>Delphos</hi> was wont to treat its Votaries, by bellowing them out such mysterious Responses, as ever <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded all,</hi> but seldom <hi>advantag'd any</hi> of them: or at least have but given a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edition of that mystical Theologie which had been so darkly adumbrated by the Sybils, as that the very Ink with which they wrote it, was scarcely black enough to be embleme unto that deepest shadow wherewith it was muffl'd up and obscur'd. And so their Divinity had been but still heathen as to that; when it had been still as little intelligible and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as any that ever past under that name. It was therefore reserv'd to be the great glory and excellency of the Christian Religion, to expresse all its Doctrine and Oracles with such genuine perspicuity and distinctnesse, as that none could innocently remain <hi>ignorant</hi> or <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:204593:111"/> of its meaning; or needed so much to exercise their Sagacity as their Faith, in their search and scrutiny after it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in that consisted one great preheminence which it carried, not only over the Theology of the Gentiles, but even over the Jewish Institution too. For, as the Apostle himself argueth it (2 Cor. chap. 3. ver. 7, 8, 9, 11.), <hi>if the ministration of Death, which was engraven on stones, was glorious,</hi> or perspicuous (as he himself supposes it was, and as it was showen to be from the fifth to the ninth Section), <hi>which glory was to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Condemnation be glory, much more doth the Ministration of Righteousness exceed in glory; and if that which was done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is so.</hi> Hence he infers (ver. 12, 16, 18.) <hi>Seing then we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech; and the Vail being taken away, we all with open face, behold as in a Glass the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the same I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:204593:111"/> from glory, to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> or even as if every particular one had been himself immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately inspir'd from above. Therefore in the beginning of the next Chapter he continues thus, <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost;</hi> (to wit through their own fault), <hi>in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospel of Christ should shine unto them: for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.</hi> ver. 1. to 6. This passage is so very plain, for the <hi>plainness</hi> of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell that it quite supersedes the need of quoting any moe of those many, which to this same purpose are to be found in every page of the New Testament.

Now if the Dispensation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was so very pat and distinct in every thing that belong'd, not only to their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Manners, but even their Faith too (considering what allowance is to be given upon the account of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:204593:112"/> only awaited the glory of their <hi>Israel,</hi> and those dayes wherin the Vision and Prophecy was to be seal'd up), as it was evidenc'd to have been in the Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that last were cited: then how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly <hi>punctual</hi> and <hi>express</hi> must be the Christian, which so far does exceed and transcend it? <hi>Since even that which was made glorious had no glory, in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth,</hi> as the Apostle draweth the consequence, 2 Cor. chap. 3. ver. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But that there be no mistake here, we must remark that the comparison is not so much founded upon that evidence, whereby the real and certain <hi>beeing</hi> and <hi>existence</hi> of these two Revelations was made manifest, when in that the Jewish could hardly be overcome; but only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the evidence, or clear and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous discovery of the <hi>nature</hi> of those things themselves which were reveal'd. And it was as palpable and clear to any Jew that God gave the Law upon the Mount, at it was to any Christian that JESUS CHRIST was sent by GOD, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:204593:113"/> was GOD himself with us, and the true Messiah; the Credentials which Attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the one being as little lyable to be disputed, as what did witnesse the other. But the difference was in this, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Mosaical Typs and Prefigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor yet the Predictions and Auguries of the Prophets did so perspicuously hold out and reveal the Messiah, and those mysteries which were with himself to be published unto the world, as did the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries which himself and his Apostles made of them afterwards; as is beyond all exception most evidently certain. So that tho the light they enjoyed was no Meridian, but as S. <hi>John</hi> speakes (ch. 1. ver. 5.) <hi>a light shining in darknesse, which comprehended it not,</hi> and therefore did not so clearly Illustrate those objects of which it gave them but a darker view; yet they had as good ground to be assur'd that they did certainly behold it, as if it had been never so much refulgent with the most glaring, and conspicuous relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency that did afterwards appear. As every body doubts as little, that the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:204593:113"/> day has broke when he sees the dawn has quite dispell'd the blacknesse of those melancholy shades which benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Horizon, as that the indefatigably posting Sun has climb'd the steepest path to his equally Coruscant and Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Noon, when he darrs hardly lift up an eye to look him in the dazling face there: tho his Earlier Shine cannot so brightly illuminate and adorn the Azure Welkine wherein he drives his Career, nor the inferiour Regions which own all their beauty and lustre to his refreshing glances; as can those advanced beams which are impartially diffus'd from his loftiest Throne unto the very crispled fringes of that hovering Sky that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the irradiated Hemisphere. Or, as (to touch the other similitude of the Prophet) none who sies the fainter light of the pale and silver Moon sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingled with the yet fainter twinklings of those remoter Stars which stude and sparkle the darkned Firmament, scruples more that it Lanthorns the World in the absence of its greater and original Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:204593:114"/> than that it is clearlier enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by This, when he beholds its fully resplendent and naifest Rays pleasantly to enamel the glistering and furbished Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens with their liveliest paint and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: tho the one cannot so well serve him, as can the other, for prying into all the little-screws and revolutions of some curious and delicate Machine; or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the smaller Characters and Draughts, which in a narrower volumn comprizes the whole Book of the Heavenly Oracles. By all which it appears, both that the Jewes had little (if any thing at all) less evidence, that the Revelation communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto them did really proceed from GOD; than have the Christians, that he was the true Author of theirs: and also, that even the very same things which were imparted by both the Revelations, were done <hi>so,</hi> as much more clearly by the <hi>latter,</hi> than by the <hi>former,</hi> as propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally the light of the <hi>Sun</hi> does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the radiancy of seven dayes that of only one.</p>

Even so there are truths evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to a greater Master, which are quite mysterious to his Disciple and Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; but especially there are such, as are clearly and distinctly penetrated by GOD, Angels, and Saints, which yet do whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transcend the most refin'd Wit of us poor sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And so at that rate, every thing that were but true, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Trinity it self, behov'd to be ob-objectively evident also; and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively obscure too: when there is no possible Proposition, that is not false, or of a contingent verity, but whose Terms are clearly connected in the sight of some Understanding, Gods at least; as on the contrary there is none so evident to any, but what perhaps might be not so, unto some Intellect, which the infinite poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of defect below that does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. However, it cannot but be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that some truths are, either in themselves more apportion'd unto the uptaking of weaker capacities, or else more condescendingly exprest unto them, than others are. And if that be to be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:204593:115"/> objectively <hi>evident,</hi> then that is mostly so, which appears unto the lowest and weaker Understandings: al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ho absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaking, every truth comparatively to the faculty proportion'd to discern it, is equally evident with any other that needs not so advanc'd an acutenesse. And objectively <hi>mysterious</hi> or <hi>obscure</hi> is just the contrary. But still it is clear that if we would generally call a thing obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively evident, or obscure, we must before assign such a degree of Intellecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in respect of which, it is either. And so all the <hi>evidence</hi> or <hi>obscurity</hi> of a thing consists in the manner of expressing it to such or such a person: which has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of absolutenesse in it at all. Now there being a great difference betwixt the <hi>beeing,</hi> and the <hi>manner of the beeing</hi> of a <hi>thing,</hi> either of these may be evident, or <hi>mysterious,</hi> accordingly as they are <hi>so</hi> exprest. And the <hi>first,</hi> being sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attested, without a clear discovery of the <hi>second,</hi> is properly and only the Object of Faith; but <hi>both,</hi> being distinctly

               <p n="2">2. Now tho the Christian Religion does contain in it many sublime and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Mysteries, such as even <hi>Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to look into;</hi> yet the most abstruse and recondite of them all, are perspicuously enough revealed, in so far as concerns the apprehensions of Faith, and as the meer <hi>being,</hi> without the <hi>manner of the being of them,</hi> is discovered unto us. Thus tho the Trinity, for example, be not so fully made manifest, as that we may clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:204593:116"/> that deep and heavenly Mystery it self. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself clears all this by that elegant <hi>seeming</hi> contradiction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he enticed the <hi>Ephesians to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge</hi> (Eph. ch. 3. ver. 19.): it not being more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd by what is said, than it does pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably confirm and attest it. And so it follows equally, that the Gospel is not my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriously reveal'd, and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that revelation it is still a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And indeed it behov'd to have been so; unless our LORD and SAVIOUR had come to convert our Earth unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to leave us no room for Faith, but forestal and anticipate the Beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by the entire manifestation of those sublime and lofty Mysteries, which are to be known there, when <hi>we shall see God himself</hi> (in whom all that is mysterious is concenter'd, and will be laid open) <hi>face to face, and know him as we shall be known of him</hi> (1 Cor. ch. 13. ver. 12.), <hi>and shall see him as he is</hi> (1 Joh. chap. 3. ver. 2.), and so leave us nothing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

               <p n="4">4. These supernatural truths then were revealed unto us, to raise our admiration of, and gratitude for, the as boundless as inconceivable Goodness, and Mercy, and Love, and Power, and Justice, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of that infinitely gracious Deity, whose every Attribute has seem'd to be at a vye with its fellows, how to exert it self the most signally in the wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:204593:122"/> mould and temper, as to busie themselves with any other things in Religion, than those, which they look upon as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indispensible for them. And so when they reckon none for such, but what the shallowest Plebeian ought not to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, it is but to be even to themselves to take up there, and neglect all others, as what were only ordain'd for the Schools, and those whose peculiar Trade it would be to study them. This sure is a mistake so dangerous, that hardly any pains can be more worth the while, than those which may detect and lay it open. And for the better doing of that, we must take notice of a distinction which the Necessaries do commonly fall under.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that is, as they import an <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>intrinsick,</hi> or only an <hi>extrinsick</hi> and <hi>respective</hi> necessity. In that sense, every thing is necessary, which of its own self has an intrinsick tendency to beget those holy dispositions in men, whereby they can only be adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Salvation, and does not regard the circumstances of any man in particular,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:204593:122"/> but only of Mankind in gross. In this, all those are such, that are sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by GOD, whatever be the matter they contain; becoming only <hi>so</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>the general account of Faith,</hi> and <hi>formal Reason</hi> or <hi>motive,</hi> upon which it depends; when there are sufficient means of conviction, respectively to such and such particular persons, that such and such Truths are attested by that Infinite Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which can neither be deceived it self, nor yet deceive others; so as that they cannot reject them, but they must call the revealer a liar, or deny his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And this by consequence is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himself, and by a further consequence to deny the Fundamental Article of all Religion: and so every <hi>extrinsecally</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Point becomes at the rebound to be <hi>intrinsecally</hi> so; so long as the proposal sufficient for conviction does remain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But it must be notic'd that even no absolutely and intrinsecally Necessary Point can at all be accounted necessary to any particular person, before it has once become to be extrinsecally and respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:204593:123"/>
                  <hi>so</hi> too. Since no Article can be any wise obligatory, before it be once so suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propos'd, as that it cannot be any longer disbeliev'd, without prevaricating against that obligation, which binds all men to yield their assent whensoever there is sufficient means for conviction that the Supream Veracity does exact it. And so every intrinsecally Necessary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle must be extrinsecally necessary like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, or sufficiently propos'd as reveal'd by GOD, in <hi>general,</hi> to all Mankind, and in <hi>particular,</hi> to the several Individuals of it; before that very intrinsick necessity with which it is so fraughted, can be so far actuate as to touch any body at all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet when the Necessaries are treated with relation to the Dispensation of the Gospel, and as they are clearly reveal'd by it for the Salvation of all men, this respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and extrinsick necessity should never be so much as once thought upon. For since that respective necessity does arise from the several applications of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Act of Faith, <hi>the believing all that is attested by God,</hi> unto particular objects,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:204593:123"/> upon <hi>sufficient conviction</hi> that they were so testified; there can be no certain gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule to determine upon what matters that application falls, and so neither to determine what are invested with that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. Because the Application of that general Rule unto any particular matter, depends necessarily upon the emergency of sufficient convictions in behalf of that particular; and these convictions do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as much as the capacities and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of particular persons, nay and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times are in two for both the extreams of the same contradiction (tho one must certainly labour under some deception or other); and so 'twere much easier to shape a Coat for the Moon, which might fit it in all the several places of the World at the same time, than contrive any such general Rule for such an application, and so for that respective necessity of which we talk. But here when we say that the Gospel is plain and clear in all the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, we take it for that general Rule according to which these are judged. And therefore we cannot mean of any respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:204593:124"/> or extrinsick necessity when relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to such a Rule only we discourse of them. Besides were such a necessity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in that case, there were no more said, but that the Gospel was clear in such necessaries, as it was clear in; or was clear, where it was clear; as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest: Since that respective necessity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving all the convictions of those upon whom it happens to fall, does but tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize and repeat that clearness which was only so in respect of these convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And further, it is only the <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Object of Faith, or that <hi>which</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that is here considered, and not the <hi>Formal,</hi> or that <hi>for which</hi> the other is assented unto. Because, when we are to examine what things the Gospel can be said to reveal clearly, the enquiry must fall allanerly upon the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as they are the Object of such a perspicuous Revelation; and so upon that which is only the <hi>material Object</hi> of Faith: since what is the Object of that clearness, is <hi>such</hi> too. But whatever that respective ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, as such, does import, concerns not the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:204593:124"/>
                  <hi>material,</hi> but peculiarly belongs to the <hi>formal</hi> Object, in so far as the means of conviction do so.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is true that no <hi>objective</hi> or <hi>absolute</hi> evidence or perspicuity can be but so much as imagin'd without some regard to that which uses to be called <hi>subjective</hi> and <hi>respective,</hi> as was shewed in <hi>Sect.</hi> 23. <hi>Par.</hi> 1. And so before any thing can be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to be objectively evident, there must be assign'd such a degree of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and subjective evidence in respect of which it is only so. But that <hi>respective</hi> evidence ought to correspond to that thing which is of an <hi>objective,</hi> so, as that if the one be of a <hi>general</hi> consideration, the other must be so too, and if of a <hi>particular,</hi> both must be of the same. Wherefore since the Gospel, (as it is maintain'd to be evident and plain in the discovery of all those Truths that are necessarily to be believ'd in order to the salvation of all men) cannot but be lookt upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the first of <hi>these</hi> two, and as it has an equal aspect to all those men whose salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be attain'd by it; therefore it must
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:204593:125"/> be only plain and evident in regard of them <hi>all</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> without any partial respect to <hi>any</hi> of them at all in <hi>particular.</hi> And therefore that degree of conviction or subjective evidence which must be pitcht upon, that it may be said to be objectively clear and manifest, must be such, as may take in the whole species of Mankind, and be so general as not to have an eye more to any one, than to any other of them all. And this is it which we only do here intend.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now that the Necessaries, as they are <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>intrinsecally</hi> such, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be confin'd into such a narrow and stinted exception, as was exprest in the beginning of the Section; but should be extended to a far larger, comprehending, at least, all such Points, as are requisite for all times, and circumstances; either with respect to any whatsoever particular persons, whether of weaker, or more improv'd Capacities; or else to whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, or rather the whole Catholick Church; so as that nothing can lawfully excuse or exempt any from the explicite
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:204593:125"/> and distinct belief of the whole Systeme of such <hi>Credenda,</hi> but the <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> impossibility of being able, either to understand and take them up, thorow the shallowness of weak Induements, or to receive sufficient information and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of them, thorow the destitution of qualified and accomplished Teachers; whereas either the one, or the other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, would be abundant apology for the ignorance of most of them at least: that these Necessaries, I say, should be constructed to be of so large an extent, is to me so very evident and certain, that after the affair is sufficiently deliberated, I should much doubt of his ingenuity, who would say he did so with it. And that this may also be as manifest to all the World, I shall go on with these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Considerations;</p>
               <p n="7">7. First, GOD directs his Laws, not to this or that single Man in particular, but to all Men by the lump; so that, as they flow from him, they carry no peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment alongst with them, more for one, than for another. Otherwise he behov'd,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:204593:126"/> either immediatly to suggest his will to every individual of Mankind himself, or else to send out as many Messages to the World as it has Inhabitants. And how much that would confound the present Providence &amp; Oeconomy whereby he will have the World to be governed, every body without the least assistance of any perspective cannot but discern.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Secondly then, All Mankind, taken absolutely and in the bulk, lies under the same equal obligation of doing the utmost that is morally possible, in performance of those Duties which their God and Creator requires of them. For under that consideration they are abstracted from all those several circumstances, which can only be suppos'd to vary the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any one from <hi>that</hi> of any of the rest; and are lookt upon meerly as such Rational Creatures, of such a degree of perfection and advancement in those Powers and Faculties, whereby they are rendered to be such, as is <hi>common</hi> to the whole Species and Kind. And therefore every individual and single Man, as he is
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:204593:126"/> one of such a Community, under that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplication, is tyed to no more, nor no less, than every one of his fellows who with him combine to make it up, as they are members of it likewise. And if it were otherwise, there could not but be such a partiality in laying on the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon those, who were bound to more, or less, than their neighbours; as any sooner than GOD might be imagin'd to have been the Imposer. Because there would be an <hi>unequal exaction</hi> from <hi>equal capacities and circumstances.</hi> Hence, had nothing interveen'd to have altered <hi>these,</hi> that had been certainly in Effect, which is now only in Scheme and Speculation. Neither is it conceiveable how any of the Progeny of <hi>Adam</hi> could have lain under any different incumbency from that which press'd upon himself, had he persever'd in that state of Innocence, which had entail'd these same equal advantages upon his Off-spring, wherewith GOD had then blist him.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But Sin, the woful Author of all discord and confusion, having introduc'd
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:204593:127"/> such a variety and discrepance among the induements and circumstances of Men, as what is possible (<hi>morally,</hi> I mean always here) for one to perform, is altogether the contrary for another; Therefore Thirdly, Every particular person, under that regard, is peculiarly bound, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi> as his circumstances renders him capable to comply with that Obligation, which in the general is exacted from his whole Kind: so that every one, who makes the nearest approach to that degree of natural perfection, which fals under the consideration of being the Specifick whereby to difference his Kind from any other, and respectively to which such an Obligation was impos'd, ought corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondently to make such an advance in his Obedience, as might the nearliest exhaust that Obligation it self. As on the other hand, however much or little short any comes of it, yet if he did all that he was able to do, he must be understood to have as punctually acquit himself in his duty; as has he, who, furnished with proportionable advantages, did wholly
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:204593:127"/> live up to the fullest excellency of that Obedience unto which all his Kind was engaged.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Yet Fourthly, He cannot owe his having done so unto the sufficiency of that performance <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>materially</hi> considered; for 'tis palpable that nothing less than the entirest conformity unto the <hi>common</hi> Obligation could have been enough upon that account. Since any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, whereby he could discharge himself of that oblgation which lies upon him, if <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>materially</hi> taken, must respect him only as divested of all those several circumstances whereby he is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a <hi>particular</hi> Person (unless, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the first consideration, there were a particular Law suppos'd to be promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate for him allanerly); and so nothing less than so much as could suffice for him, as a Man, under an absolute and general view, could on that head serve to do his turn. But those languid and hinting aims did especially derive more value from the ingenuous simplicity, and ill circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances wherein they were brought forth;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:204593:128"/> than any exactness and conformity unto that obligation which they clambered to fulfil. Wherefore it may be more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous for one to climb up but the very lowest step of Obedience, than for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be towring upon the highest pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of it at all. Because the Parts and Circumstances of both being compar'd, there may be a greater disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>these,</hi> than between those <hi>material peices</hi> of their Duty which were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by each of them. And so the sufficiency and perfection of that <hi>materially less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> Performance, is precisely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded upon the circumstances and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of him by whom it was elicite; which, by how much worse they are, do by so much enhance what was begot in and by them; recompensing all the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial defect,</hi> by the irreservedness of all that they were capable of; an accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, formally notic'd, ceds not to the highest any can pretend to, when none can do more than he is able to do, and the doing all that, abundantly absolves him. Thus was the Widows Mite rated,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:204593:128"/> upon the score of being her All, above the greater Oblations, that had no such recommendation to set them off. And GOD never <hi>reaps where he hath not sown, but accepts according to that a man hath, and not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cording to that he hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12. It being as much contrary to his Justice, as it is to his Goodness, to task men with impossibilities, or those things which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self knows transcends the utmost of their abilities to afford him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Wherefore in the fifth place, it is to be notic'd that GOD, in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of our Salvation, did not design, at the sending of his Son, to redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate again unto Mankind those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural endowments which were crusht by his Fall; or with an equal improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to advance the Intellects of every one unto such a degree of natural knowledge (for some must still be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppos'd) as was most necessary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for receiving those supernatural communications whereby the <hi>Mystery kept secret since the world began,</hi> was more fully imparted to the whole Race, so as
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:204593:129"/> that all should be equally capable to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate and comprehend those sublime discoveries of it, which the brightest Rays of the <hi>Day-spring from on High</hi> so clearly did make. And so his blessed Son, when come to the World, did leave that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready established disparity amongst men (as much as to their Understandings, and the accomplishments of them, as on any other respect whatsoever), which either the various Composure of their Bodies, or the diversities of their education, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned, in the same unaltered estate wherein it was before.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And therefore sixthly, having pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished his Gospel with an equal respect to all Mankind in general, he cannot be thought but to have adapted it only for the whole Mass of such Reasonable Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; so as that, as it is <hi>materially</hi> taken, and with respect to <hi>these,</hi> there might not be any of never so favourable advantages which might not find exercise and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment enough for the utmost improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and endeavours of them. And indeed since Providence has blest severals with
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:204593:129"/> such plentiful provisions as exempt them from those pinching straits and necessities others groan and sweat under, that what industry is spar'd their Bodies may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed in cultivating and exalting their Minds; it follows by all the Laws of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that those who are so sever'd and discriminated from the Vulgar, should not be let pass with disproportionable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns unto that Bounty which has so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care of their subsistence, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in those Intellectual indowments, in which they ought to be as much qualified above the common size, as it is below those peculiar blessings which so elevats them; it being all reason to expect their soaring higher, who are so freed from those loads and weights which clogg and depress others. Neither could it ever be the design of him, who breath'd the <hi>breath of life,</hi> a Soul essentially <hi>active</hi> and <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, into our nostrils,</hi> to surround any with those competent advantages which afford leasure in abundance from all the cumbersome entanglements of this World, meerly that they might indulge and dandle
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:204593:130"/> themselves in the oscitant supine Yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Idleness and Sloath, or pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and tickle those filthy Lusts and Sensualities, which can but bury the more Excellent and Divine Part of them in luxury and stench; as was shewed in the first Paragraph of the first Section. But when to these so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive bodily mercies, which afford both the freedom of an ingenious educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and also of employing that time which so abounds (there being no reasonable ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to waste and prostitute it with those baser scramblings which indigent persons are forc'd unto) for those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent purposes for which so happy an Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution does enable; when to these, I say, that transcendant ennoblement of all, a smart and pregnant Wit, able and brisk enough for the loftier flights in whatever Science or Contemplation, is superadded; then the correspondent accession of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compliance with that duty which all Men, as such, are tyed unto, must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be devolv'd also. Because that is a special grace of GOD too. Since the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:204593:130"/> Spirits of Men are, by his particular as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signment, who keeps the very <hi>hairs of our heads in number, and lets none of them fall to the ground without him,</hi> like that Ground mentioned in the Gospel, some whereof brought forth fruit at an hundred fold, some at sixty, some at thirty; so as that some of them are of that more polite and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile constitution which is capable of the most acute and refin'd Improvements, whereas others are of so stubborn and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable a Mould, as that hardly the most assiduous Husbandry can mellow them into any plyant or docile frame at all.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But on the other hand, the nobler stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Mind requiring an undisturb'd vacancy from those servile Drudgeries wherein the generality of Men are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merst, and our mortal condition making these altogether necessary; it was but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that no higher qualifications or advances in Religion should have been exacted from the Vulgar and laborious Rank, than what rude and unfashioned Nature was capable to acquire; unless
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:204593:131"/> he, who once was figured by Manna, should at his appearance have superseded any further toil in the World, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated dayly showers of that ancient Type of himself: and all this especially, when such peoples Souls use, for the most part, to be the fittest Guests that could readily have been lodged in such thatched Cottages, as are their Bodies, no less, than those Earthen-houses wherein they shelter themselves. And so there cannot any thing be deem'd more just and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, than that as GOD, on the one hand, stoops and <hi>bowes down his Heavens</hi> to the frailty and imperfections nece <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arly attending the weaker and needier sort; so he should, on the other, proportion his exactions by the good things which he has vouchsaft, according to the Parable of the Talents. Nay were it but to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Reputation, and not (by such a promiscuous scattering of his Benefits without any regard where they were to fall, as no humane prudence would be guilty of) expose his Wisdom unto the scorn and derision of his own Creatures,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:204593:131"/> nay and of those same who were parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the profusion; he could not do otherwise: but behov'd to take as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of what he has dispenst, as was the providence by which he did it, and the design which that propos'd. And the great end for which he created Man being that himself might be glorified by his rational and vertuous Obedience, the principal design he can have in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any favours upon him, is certainly the better to fit and enable him to pursue and comply with that end; and so higher advancements in Religion are especially the Debt which such Receipts engage unto; because these being chiefly the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Soul, the more that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled, the more it is to be prolifick in them.</p>
               <p n="14">14. From all which it clearly follows what in the sixth place was laid down, <hi>viz.</hi> That CHRIST JESUS did so reveal his Gospel with respect to all Mankind in General, as that there could not be any in it but it would afford him work enough for all the most signal advantages
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:204593:132"/> that he could be capable to enjoy in this present World. Because, if he had not done so, but had proportion'd the whole Systeme of the <hi>material object</hi> of it unto the lowest and meanest degree of the Parts and Circumstances of those who crawl among the vulgar and unpolished Rabble, and so had exacted no more from those who are happy in the more affluent distribution of the Comforts of Life, and endued with the more nimble and elevated Understandings, but to know so much, as those others, so vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly below them upon either account; either all that has been said in those two last Paragraphs must fall quite down to the ground, and the surplusage of those peculiar advantages which so many triumph in above their Neighbours, were cast away gratis, without any suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able retribution to be made for it; or else, as much contrary to what was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the seventh Paragraph, he had resolv'd immediatly to inspire every single man by himself, and inform him of so much of that Religion whereby he could
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:204593:132"/> only be sav'd, as would minutely corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond with his <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>respective</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, which required a <hi>different</hi> exaction from that whereunto others may be liable. I know none that ever held any thing like <hi>this latter,</hi> save it be the Quakers; and it is so far their own <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate spirit</hi> that suggests the fancy to them of such a dream about <hi>One,</hi> that waking people who would be at the pains to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them, might become to be suspected of something worse than meerly to dream too. And as for the <hi>former,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what has been already said in the general; what more unworthy could be imagin'd, than that none of all those, who are as closely hedg'd &amp; fenced about with all manner of blessings, even as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil said <hi>Job</hi> was, should not be obliged to have any more full and distinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the infinite excellency of GOD, of the unspeakable love he manifested to man in sending his own eternally begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son to die for, and redeem him, of the ineffable consubstantiality of that Son with his Father, and Divinity of the Man
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:204593:133"/> CHRIST JESUS, the great endearment of that mercy nor of the various estates of Innocency, Misery, and Grace, which poor Man himself has been tost into, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than the most stupid and illiterate dunce, that gives something like ground enough to make it be scrupled, whether or not there be any middle species of Creatures betwixt Mankind and Beasts, that have the Body of the one, and no finer Soul than the Animal one of the other?</p>
               <p n="15">15. Whence seventhly, it is evident that, according to what was made out in the eighth Paragraph, every one in all Mankind is equally oblig'd with all the rest expresly to know no less extensive a Creed, than what was compos'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the whole Species; in so far, to wit, as he is denuded of all his circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and considered meerly as a Man: tho as cloath'd with <hi>these,</hi> and if there be a readiness to will, or a willing mind, the performance out of that which every one hath, is smil'd upon and accepted by him, who <hi>remembers that he is but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:204593:133"/> So that rigorously speaking, and meerly considering what belongs to the material Object of Faith intrinsecally relating to those Diviner improvements which the Gospel chiefly intends, there is no extent of it sufficient for Salvation, these terms being generally taken, but what is <hi>so</hi> for one in the most exalted and advantagious condition unto which this mortal state can possibly arrive. And therefore, as it was pursued in the tenth Paragraph, there is none who is sav'd by less, but he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden for that, not altogether unto the sufficiency of that part of the Christian Faith, <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>materially</hi> considered; but to the compassion and connivance of that GOD, who choos'd rather to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the narrowness of those endeavours which flow from an ingenuous sincerity, before he would alter that inequality in mens conditions and endowments, which could not have suffered a change, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the present Oeconomy of this World had endur'd One too.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now let us subjoyn Eightly. That therefore the Necessary Faith for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:204593:134"/> as it is absolutely noticed without respect to this or that man in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, must be taken in as ample a sense, as the sixth Paragraph did assign it: and that there can be no more preposterous a method in handling this subject, than to begin at the lowest rank of men, in the worst circumstances they can be in as Christians, and, from what is resolv'd upon as sufficient to save them, conclude that there is no more necessary for the salvation of any, to wit, upon the account of that immediate Aspect unto the special and main end of the Divine Revelation, which discriminats a Necessary &amp; Essential Point; and so to judge of all the rest of Christianity, from what is not so, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in its self, and whereto none is bound without the intervention of the meerest peradventure. Just so as if one were to distinguish betwixt Christian Vertue and Perfection (either <hi>intensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> or <hi>extensively</hi> taken) that is necessary for Salvation upon the account of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick tendency to make one meet to be partaker of the Inheritance of the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:204593:134"/> Saints in Light, and only upon that of the Command of GOD promulgate with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence enough to render it binding: He would, to determine precisely what <hi>degree</hi> or <hi>extent</hi> of Perfection is sufficient in the first respect, commence down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and, from what is found enough to prepare a mean rude Cobler or Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd for the being capable of Glory, thence infer, that so much, and no more, is required from any, in however ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious circumstances, and of howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sublime accomplishments; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would cut off all other performances and more aspiring flights of Holinesse and Love, from that nobler regard unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which the Gospel mainly designs, as a supererogatory kind of obedience none is oblig'd unto upon any other score, but that of its being enjoyn'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd. Yea, there is a necessity that he who follows such a perverse and sinistru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous course in the one, must do so in the other also: when the Acts of the Will cannot but own a proportion unto those of the Understanding, upon which they
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:204593:135"/> are essentially subsequent and depending, and to which the obligation must be both prior, and at least equal to that of their own selves. And therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> (2. <hi>Epist ch</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 18.) does more than insinuate an equal Duty of advancing in Holiness, and Faith; when he exhorts all to <hi>Grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;</hi> the whole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Verb, <hi>Grow,</hi> falling no less upon the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> than <hi>Grace,</hi> he so recommends. Neither is there any thing more clear to this purpose, than that of the <hi>Ephes. chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 12, to 15. Where it is not purely the <hi>Ʋnity of the Faith,</hi> which the Apostle intends should <hi>perfect the Saints, till they all come unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ;</hi> but the <hi>Faith</hi> it self, and the <hi>Knowledge of the Son of God.</hi> Since that Ʋnity is but a circumstance subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the Faith, which is only the thing able to produce such an advancement; and is only considerable as a mean to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the purity and truth of it; in so far as there being but one Faith, the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:204593:135"/> conspiration of all that professe it renders the creeping in of any Errour into any part of its whole Systeme, impossible, <hi>viz</hi> so long as that Unity continues; as having blockt up all the avenues by which it could have only got entrance, such as Discord and Strife. Hence he goes on <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. And consequently to which he prayes (Phil. chap. 1. ver. 9.) that their <hi>love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgement.</hi>

And the truth is, could those few Articles of the Christian Faith, which may serve to conduct the simple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned unto Heaven, be thought fully to comprize all that ought to be called absolutely necessary for Salvation, when yet all who move in any higher Orb of induements are oblig'd to know moe than those; one might as well say that such general Propositions as only a poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Idiot were able to comprehend, were all <hi>those,</hi> which could be call'd abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely evident with respect to Mankind in general: which none can be so much an Idiot as to imagine. Likewise suppose
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:204593:136"/> that twenty men were each of them rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me a thousand pounds, and non but one or two were worth so much, some having but nine hundred, some but eight, some four, some three, and some not an hundred at all, but single twenty, or ten, or five, or only one. Now suppose also that I to whom they were endebted, were content to take from every one what he was able to pay, and thereupon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite him. Pray, can it be said that one, or two, or ten, or an hundred, or any thing lesse than the whole thousand pounds, was that, which, absolutely and materially taken, with regard to all the twenty men that were my Debters, was sufficient to pay me of the total Sum? Assuredly none will do it, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands but what such expressions use to signifie, and how they are to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted. Any minute application here is so very obvious, that it could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent too.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But further, we know how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is debated whether or not the express and distinct knowledge even of the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:204593:136"/> Christian Religion it self, be so indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly necessary for Salvation, as that even those, whose circumstances renders it quite impossible for them ever to enjoy those requisite means whereby they could come to the sufficient notice of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be capable of being saved, because of that ignorance. It is true there is no small probability from the Scriptures for enclining us to embrace the Affirmative. But on the other hand, it is hard to get over the Negative before it be first made out, that God does not accept of that sincere intention, which universally disposes one to believe whatever shall be sufficiently attested unto him to have been revealed by God, when that which in particular is accounted as <hi>such</hi> is not <hi>so;</hi> and therefore that even an innocent errour, or ignorance as to <hi>this,</hi> does pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the honesty of that general pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose whereby the mind was subjected unto whatever it sees bearing the Seal of Divine veracity upon it, even tho it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistook in the particulars because of the impossibility in such circumstances
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:204593:137"/> not to have fail'd; and so that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more from men, than what in their respective capacities and estates it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for them to grant. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before that thorny question, bandied with so much argument on both sides, be once resolv'd; the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it self cannot be said to be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary for Salvation, even as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards all Mankind in general: and the absolute sufficiency of Faith must be taken, not from the <hi>material Object,</hi> but from that general Act of it, <hi>the believing all that God sayes, to be true;</hi> supposing that upon the use of all moral diligence there can no conviction be had of any <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> that GOD did indeed reveal; and that an universal promptitude of mind to embrace whatsoever can be found to have proceeded from such an Authority, does attest the ingenuity of these endeavours that were imployed in it. And who does not see that nothing would be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly impertinent to the present purpose than thus to refound that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity, of which all along we
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:204593:137"/> have been speaking, upon that which is so infinitly far unconcerned in the affair, that it is all one to it, however that should go: when that general Act of Faith, is at that rate sufficient to compound for whatever defect may be in any <hi>particular mate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ial Object</hi> to which it is applyed. But this was already considered in the fourth Paragraph.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Let us therefore conclude that, as nothing can suffice for the Salvation of any, meerly upon the account of the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Object,</hi> and abstracting from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to particular persons, but the whole Systeme of that Faith which was generally reveal'd with respect to mankind in gross, so as that every man, <hi>absolutely considered,</hi> is oblig'd to an express and distinct belief of all the several Articles of the Christian Religion, that were at all reveal'd by CHRIST himself, or his Holy Spirit, with a design'd subserviency to Holiness and Vertue; and he is not capable of Bliss so long as any of them is not <hi>explicitely</hi> and <hi>positively</hi> believ'd by him; not only because the not believing of it, would
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:204593:138"/> reject what GOD himself has affirm'd with convincing enough evidence, and so would give him the lie; but especially, because it would deprive of that which has an intrinsick regard unto that inward Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Righteousness, and those elevated performances which the Gospel requires: As all this, I say, is irrefragably manifest by reason of what has been said; so it is, that the Necessary and Essential Points for Salvation, as they are <hi>absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered mith respect to all Mankind,</hi> must comprize <hi>the whole material Object</hi> of Faith, in so far as it has any <hi>intrinsick ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> to ennoble and perfite the Souls of Men; and therefore must be as far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as the common obligation that lyes upon Mankind to believe the Gospel, does any ways reach. And it is of all such that I mean, when I say that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is plain and evident in the Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; the <hi>plainness</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> being absolute at that rate, at which the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries are; to wit, as Mankind in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is only regarded by either. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every one cry out with that poor
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:204593:138"/> man in the Gospel, <hi>I believe, Lord Jesus help my unbelief;</hi> and that as much upon the account of the <hi>extensiveness,</hi> as of the <hi>firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the assent. Not that I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve any in those mazes of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and Scholastick Subtilties, which are more apt to <hi>confound,</hi> than <hi>edifie;</hi> but that with humble, and ingenuous, and sincere endeavours they would assiduous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consult those Means which GOD has appointed for instructing the World what it is he would have as well Believ'd, as Practis'd, with <hi>Davids</hi> Blessed man, <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating in the law of the Lord both day and night.</hi> For there is no fear, but he who looks upon himself as the most happily arriv'd at the highest point of Learning and Acuteness, will find it task enough to drain or exhaust that <hi>Fountain of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waters, which springs up to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. WE have now had before our eyes the whole Scheme and Platform of GODS Revelation to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and have trac'd it all along from its first commencement even in Paradise, ay and while it expir'd and determined with the lives of the holy Apostles of JESUS CHRIST. And we have seen how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely vouchsafing and gracious he has been to his Church in all its several Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods and Revolutions: how very pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and condescending, and particular, and express, in manifesting Himself and his Will to the World: and that whether we consider the <hi>extrinsick,</hi> or <hi>intrinsick sufficiency</hi> of the Manifestation; whether the sufficient evidence of its own <hi>being</hi> and <hi>self,</hi> or of those things which it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, &amp; were necessary for mankind for attaining that great end and design for which it was created and redeem'd. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know I any thing now wanting entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ascertain us of the truth of both, but these two, which hitherto have for the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:204593:139"/> most part been still suppos'd as unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable; so that I would not interrupt the threed of the Discourse with them; <hi>viz.</hi> that those Prodigies &amp; Miraculous Works, which have been alleadged, were the most uncontrolable and sufficient Argument that could have been wish'd in behalf of the Divine Authority of those Doctrines in whose favours they appear'd; and that the Matter of Fact was really so, as it has been here set down.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the first, It is evident that the wonted and ordinary course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is impossible to be any wise altered, but by a Power equal to that which at first jumpt it into being. Because there requires equal force to make a thing work, either <hi>contrary</hi> unto, or <hi>above</hi> these endowments which it naturally does en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, as at first to make its own self: since in that case there is the production of an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without that proportion of a Natural Cause, which were necessarily requisite for it, were its own self alone unassisted by any higher strength, left to perform such a feat: and such a production is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:204593:140"/> accompanied with all the difficulty that Creation it self can be aggravated withal; when the most of <hi>this</hi> can be, <hi>the producing a thing out of nothing;</hi> and all <hi>that</hi> is there; that of the effect which transcends the immediate Cause, which was employed in the production of it, being no less out of nothing, than any thing can be imagin'd to be. Whence it is manifest that only GOD, who was the Author of Nature, can so dispose of it at his pleasure, as to make it <hi>outdo</hi> or <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract</hi> its own self. Nay such a stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious effect evidently demonstrats the existence of a Deity and Supream Beeing, tho that were not done before; when it does so, that there is some such uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable Power as is able to draw some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of that which is just its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to wit, nothing. And if any of those late men who are so eager to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate Atheistical Principles, will have this very Power to be called that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Nature it self, he gives but GOD another Name, than that he uses to pass under; tho upon the base design of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:204593:140"/> confounding him with what owes its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allanerly to his own good pleasure; that thereby he might the more easily shuffle himself out of any at all, and get the notion of a Miracle, which he sees so palpably to confute his attempts that way, quite dasht out of the World, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Boggle that could dastard or affright him; because then every Production would be <hi>natural,</hi> or that which only Nature issued forth. 'Tis true, that it is as natural to GOD to produce that which we call a Miracle, as it is natural to any created Beeing to exert it self in its custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary manner of operation; since the Power of GOD eminently contains what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever effect is but so much as <hi>possible,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can <hi>any</hi> exceed those it forces, which being without limits, are not capable to be surpast. And so, absolutely speaking, there can be no Miracle at all. But this is the most impertinent to our purpose that any thing could be: when we are precisely noticing the production of an effect beyond the exigency or power of its immediat second cause; if that can be
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:204593:141"/> called a Cause which of its own self was not able to have produc'd it. And such a production we call a Miracle; and it is when that appears that we are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd whether or not it be a sufficient and manifest demonstration of the Divine Authority; so as that it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible but GOD must have asserted that truth which is attended with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Miracle to confirm it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that it is so, is no lesse certain. For to conceit that GOD would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Omnipotence to be a stale and promoter unto any Forgery or Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senage that vain-glorious and designing men could set themselves to advance, were, not only blasphemously to asperse him with that blackest character which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has burnt upon the forehead of him who was a <hi>Lyar from the beginning,</hi> and so account of him under no better notion, than that of the <hi>Father of lies;</hi> but also sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously to rob and despoil him of all possible means of expressing any thing of his mind any wise convincingly to the world, or entertaining that correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:204593:141"/> between him and them, which the second Section of this Discourse did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to be so necessary in order to his concerning himself with their affairs here below: unlesse he would immediately impart himself unto the Souls and Spirits of men by such manifest illapses of his own Being and Essence into theirs, as it were impossible for them not to perceive them at that same clear and distinst rate at which they are conscious of their own selves; which, as it were unreasonable for every single man to desire any thing like it, so for him to do so, were wholly to defeat all that this Discourse has still walkt upon, <hi>viz. only such a sufficient ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of his Will as is enough ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to induce a free and vertuous obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Because to take away all <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar design</hi> from those signal exertions of his infinit Power, or yet but to allow them such a <hi>promiscuous one</hi> as could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver determine them allanerly to the abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Truth more than Falsehood, were to leave him nothing imaginable where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he could give any infallible proof or
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:204593:142"/> evidence when it was himself indeed that intended to reveal something unto Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: since whatever he could produce for that effect, could never in reason be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto; when there would be the like Authority for both the contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and as insuperable an argument would militate against any of them, as what could induce to the preferring it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the other: and so the Judgement of all whom he did addresse, could not but hover pendulous betwixt the two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating extreams, in the irresolute sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense which of them to incline or fall to. And these are such absurdities as will not readily down with any, who can but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge there can be a Miracle, or a GOD at all. And therefore on all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science we are obliged to think, that he has so reserv'd the management of that Power, by which they can only be wrought, unto his own Omnipotent self, as not to lend it unto any, but those whom he has commissionated to declare some part of his Mind and Will to the World; that so the broad Seal of Heaven being
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:204593:142"/> affixt to their Warrand, none may justly doubt of that Authority with which he has invested them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet after all this we must confesse that there may be such false and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Wonders, as may so critically resemble those which are the most real, that even the most serious Observers may be put to it, to discover wherein the mystery of them does lie. Thus many have been performed, either by the power of the Devil, whose subtile and agile nature renders him able to atchieve such strange Operations as we poor men know not well how to resolve into their natural Causes; or else by prestigiatory and jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Arts whereby a nimble hand does so swiftly and dexterously go about a Trick as the most wary of our senses can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not speedily enough follow all its several delusive and invi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ble Motions. And with these many <hi>have been,</hi> and <hi>may be</hi> so amus'd, as to be seduc'd and led astray into the most gross and abominable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Absurdities.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:204593:143"/>5. But first, Because there is so much <hi>Bristol</hi>-Stones in the World, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good consequence that there are no true Diamonds? Or have we no good Guineys, because there may be some but of guilded Glass? And if, in these and the like cases, the counterfeit does not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the <hi>reality</hi> of what is true; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it in the present. Nay 'tis no small evidence that there are true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that there are so many false ones: when otherwise, that would be the only instance wherein there were a Counterfeit, without a Reality, of which it were <hi>that.</hi> And secondly, It is impossible that the <hi>imitation</hi> can be so infinitely exact, but that a diligent scrutiny in the thing it self, &amp; the circumstances in which it is brought forth, will certainly detect it to be but <hi>such.</hi> Other wise, besides how much it is incumbent to Providence never to suffer any Imposture <hi>so</hi> to dog it at the heels, upon the account of what was said in the third Paragraph; every thing behov'd to be depriv'd of those <hi>criterions</hi> and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing marks whereby it may be known
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:204593:143"/> to be its own self, and not to be another; which is quite impossible to be imagin'd without a <hi>specifical identity</hi> between them at least; and that can never interveen betwixt Truth and Falshood, even in any Concret whatsoever; as is beyond all doubt. But thirdly, These differencing Notes are so palpable in behalf of those real Miracles which always attested the true Religion, that, as the greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition we ever read of, was that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Magicians and <hi>Moses;</hi> so the disparity was never less manifest, than then; when even those same Magicians (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever much so, as well in Morality, as in Naturals) were so evidently baffled, as to be forc'd themselves to confess <hi>the finger of God.</hi> And let the comparison be stated betwixt any Pretenders, and what was produc'd concerning the Apostles alone, in the eighteenth Section; and I doubt not but even Impudence it self would blush sooner, than alledge any the least shadow of an equality; especially if all the circumstances were sufficiently considered. But if the accomplishing
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:204593:144"/> of ancient Prophecies be reckoned with those Prodigies and Miracles which this Discourse has mentioned, then what dare be so hugely effronted as to attempt the parallel of those Credentials whereby both the Jewish and Christian Religions were confirmed: when in them such a Wisdom and Power had conspir'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as nothing but that which was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and divine, could ever have the very remotest claim unto <hi>either,</hi> and far less <hi>both</hi> of them. Besides what may be said of the excellency of the Doctrine it self, in behalf of which these are, upon <hi>this</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, even almost supererogatorily brought to be demonstrative.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is true the World is much nois'd with a succession of Miracles, no less sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and manifest, than were those of Christ and his Apostles themselves, and that by a generation of Men who pretend them for such Doctrines, as are so very uncapable of being now attested with Miracles (after those their Contradictories were so much irrefragably witnessed by them at the first broaching of Christianity), that, were it
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:204593:144"/> true which they do aver, they would, in stead of gaining any credit to their own Designs, upon their account, but enervate the proof in general, and overturn all the certainty that could be deriv'd from such Credentials to vouch the most sincere and ingenuous one of any body else; when two such irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliable Enemies, as Contradictories, can never be equally testified; and, if they were, both the witnesses would <hi>therefore</hi> mutually confound each other. And yet we hear no louder clamours, than what are perpetually grating in our ears for those; which, if they be Miracles at all, must undoubtedly be vouchsaf'd by the infinite Author of them, to evidence, either his Providence in general, or his particular concern in some vertuous Favourites; and not to own any of those Tenents, unto which he has before been so very unkind and disobliging, and which even an Angel come from Heaven could not preach without being accursed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But to treat them with so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect as even the supposal of being true
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:204593:145"/> carries along with it, cannot but affront that authentick and illustrious evidence, whereby the certain being and reality of those, which were wrought by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his Apostles, was rendered so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest and uncontrovertible. Since there was never any thing, even alleadged by the Heathen Priests themselves, more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously fabulous, than they are: as has been of late made palpable by a Discourse, on set purpose exposing them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and drollery of every one, who has but eyes to read, or ears to hear it. And therefore all I shall say, is First, If they enjoy such a Power of working Miracles, either it is for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of their Doctrine, or not? If not, then wherefore draw they any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them for that end? If it be, then wherefore do they not exercise it, as that it may serve the design for which it is entrusted? For surely there can no account be given how GOD should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow such a Power upon design of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by it those Truths which himself has reveal'd, unless it were that it might
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:204593:145"/> be so employ'd as to convince those who are to be converted unto the belief of them? But how can such be thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, unless, either they did see the wonderful effects of it themselves, or hear of them from such unexceptionable wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses as did see them, and are of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable credite and authority in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they testifie. Now was ever that Power, which these men so confidently boast, yet exerted in the midst of these who were their enemies, or were to be Proselyted unto their Opinions; as was that which CHRIST and his Apostles did show? Was it not alwayes huddl'd up in corners, and only trick'd withal before those who were already perswaded of the Doctrines which it was said to confirm: as even the pretended managers of it themselves do acknowledge? For my own part, tho for some years I travell'd all those Countreys that are the most fond about the pretence of such Miracles; Yet save it was that I saw two <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> Skulls, one at <hi>Amiens,</hi> and another at <hi>Rome</hi> (the nether Jaw being kept at
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:204593:146"/> some third place unmultiplied), and some other such Prodigies of Relicts, my eyes never yet beheld any more of them, than those <hi>Votivae Tabulae</hi> with which their Churches are all hung over, to the same purpose (for ought I could learn) that were those ancient Temples wherein some Pagan God had the glory to be Enshrin'd. And therefore such a skulking Power of Miracles cannot but be so far from answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that intention wherefore any was ever yet communicated; that tho it were never so much vouched by the most cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible relation of those among whom it is said to be; yet none in reason could but suspect, that either these were deluded themselves by the overweening force of their own wishes and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or else made it their study to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the meerest fourbs and impostures upon others, that ever was yet set upon the attempt of gaining repute in the World. And indeed I have ever strang'd how that people is not asham'd to own such a Power to be constantly resident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and yet never be able to give
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:204593:146"/> any other demonstration that it is so, but those Legendary Stories, which a body would think had been only contriv'd to make Experiment of the blindest creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherewith ever men was yet besotted and befool'd.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And secondly, Was not the true and genuine Christian Religion abundantly confirmed by Miracles in the first propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation? And had not the World then suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to yield up their assent in the belief of what was so palpably attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Wherefore then should these men so much busie themselves to keep up what the foregoing Paragraph has shewed none can justly acknowledge but for a meer Pretext at most? Do they fancy, that all that CHRIST and his Apostles did in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of their Doctrine, had not been enough to do the feat, unless they should have assisted them with their little Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank and Gypsie Tricks? But either their Tenents stands in need of Miracles to procure them credite, or not? If not, then wherefore do they afford so much occasion to <hi>charge God foolishly,</hi> or rather
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:204593:147"/> of foolishness; when thus with a <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of naughtiness,</hi> he would prostitute his Almighty Power to an equally <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> and <hi>triffling</hi> design? If they do, then they must be something else, than those which were taught by CHRIST and his Apostles? because he must be something else than a Christian, who darrs say that any of these, were, like so many bastard notions, left out of their fatherly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent care, or not sufficiently provided with Credentials to attest them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But it is enough to disparage their pretence unto me, that they have abus'd it themselves with such ridiculous and foppish instances of its energy and force, as none without something more than a common blasphemy could ascribe them to that Power which it feigns, and presumes upon. An account whereof any may have in that forementioned Discourse writ by the excellent Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who has quite forestall'd all that can be said on this Subject. As also of the equal cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility with which they are related, with that of the most fam'd and plausible Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:204593:147"/> that ever were the peculiar alleadgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of those we talk of. Besides, has there not been <hi>so many,</hi> and <hi>such conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Cheats and Forgeries discovered in that pretence, and that not only by open and avowed enemies, but also by one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of these who lay claim to it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, against another of the fame stamp; as are but too much to discredite and baffle it for ever? I remember that at <hi>Doway</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> I had from one Father <hi>Platel,</hi> a learned Jesuite, an original Copy (Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Anno</hi> 1509.) of that little Book Entituled, <hi>De quatuor Haeresiarchis Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Praedicatorum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>apud Suitenses in Civitate</hi> Bernensi <hi>combustos. A. D.</hi> 1509. In which I read the detection of such an Imposture, as abounded with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances which can be but imagin'd as desirable for confuting the most feasable of those who never yet have mett with the like misfortune. And in this little Piece the good Father was so much concerned, that he told me, when he lent it, he had of a long time been searching for it, both with much cost and pains; and now having
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:204593:148"/> found it, he hugg'd it as a thing no less dear to him than his own heart and soul. So zealous was he to have the <hi>Dominican</hi> Miracles, at least, fall under that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and reproach, which is but the just deserving of these, which use to be so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently vaunted and bragg'd of by the whole Communion wherein he liv'd. And he must be a great stranger to the World who knows not how industrious and eager, and how <hi>successful</hi> too, the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and <hi>Franciscans,</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and <hi>Carmelites,</hi> &amp;c. are in their mutual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests upon those Miracles which their several Orders do pretend. So that, tho all of them talk big things of those that are Catholick, and especially of their own peculiar concernment; yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more palpable, than their jealousie of one another, and that every one of them holds all the rest for as arrant liars, as we do them all together. Indeed it has often been the matter of my admiration, that, since the Head of their Church, on so many other respects, gives shrewd occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the World, to suspect him too
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:204593:148"/> much related to that Man, whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle so punctually describes in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of his second Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> he should so far compleat the Character in this too, as to <hi>come after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceitfulness of unrighteousness:</hi> when all those, who adore him, cannot but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to themselves, that the only effect which such a Pretence of Miracles, as is theirs, is likely to produce, cannot be any other, than for those who <hi>receive the love of the truth,</hi> to upbraid him with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But in a word, unless they could work Miracles at their pleasure, and would do so before us, who challenge them so much to do it (and in all reason, because they would have us to believe upon their account), and so would submit them to as impartial a scanning, as were those of CHRIST and his Apostles, so that our own senses might give us the immediate information of them, and it might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hese only that could be impos'd upon, if
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:204593:149"/> there were any fraud and deceit us'd in the affair; and therefore unless they would perform as mighty deeds as did our Saviour and his Apostles themselves, of an equal <hi>number</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> (for those who work Miracles at their pleasure may undoubtedly do so); they must have us excus'd before we do so much as give credite that they have the power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any at all. Because that which we look upon as the distinguishing Note and Standard of true Miracles from false, is for one to work them at his own arbitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and liking; and so, to do that, at all times, and before all persons, and in any whatsoever matter and subject; so as did those blessed men which wrought those in the first confirmation of that holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which, because of them, we do profess. For that same Power which can be sufficient for any one Miracle, must be so for any other: Since it must be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, according to what was said in the second Paragraph. And he that has it for confirming any Doctrine, must either be able to imploy it at his pleasure, or else
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:204593:149"/> no effect of it he could produce, could be interpreted but as that of <hi>chance,</hi> and not of <hi>design,</hi> and so not as intended for such an end. And so let these Miracle-mongers take us but once at this pinch, of obliging us at that rate to confesse that they have the Gift of Miracles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and then we shall tell them what next shall be said. But there is no fear they put us to such a direct answer as that would come to. Wherefore let non fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to themselves that ever their pretence has done any thing to invalidate that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which was drawn from Miracles, to demonstrate the truth of that Doctrine in whose behalf they were so signally wrought; or yet ever shall do it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AS to the the Matter of Fact; that is so very irrefragable and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that no affair could possibly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to a more desireable issue, than to have it brought thus to depend allaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon such an Evidence. For if those
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:204593:150"/> Books out of which we have taken it, can be proved to be genuine, and really to have been write, by those Persons whose Names they bear, and so enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the World, even <hi>then,</hi> as <hi>now</hi> they are; it is impossible but things must have truly stood so then, as they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them. Because it had been impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that such Books could ever have been so universally embrac'd as the unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Records of such Sacred Truths, at a time when all the world could have as easily known whether they were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the account they gave of them, as whether the Sun was shining or not; if they had not been true in their narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and affairs had indeed been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than they related they were. Since all that has been said before about the impossibility that ever the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion should have so prevailed in the World, had it been no more but a Cheat and Delusion; argues equally here, upon the account of the considerablenesse and circumstances of the subject Matter which these Books do contain: when the <hi>lesse
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:204593:150"/> probability,</hi> and the <hi>more of importance</hi> there was in it, the <hi>lesse possibility</hi> there was, that they could have been so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly believed without a proportionable evidence of the truth thereof; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they were believ'd at that rate, there behov'd, by the rule of contraries, to have been such an evidence of that; as is manifest. Nay, abstracting what may be said upon t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is respect, that any Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry so grossly false, as they had been, so that they had been false at all, should have ever been accounted of as true, and far more as infallible, by so many men, which could not but be sensible that it was so false; were as great madnesse to think, as it would have been for all these to have so accounted of it. We may but imagine what acceptance any Book would now get among us, did it romance such another Story as that of the Holy Bible, and yet endeavour to vent it, as no fiction or imposture. And it were too arrogant for us to conceit that we had ingross'd all the Wit and Prudence that has been in the World, and that those of former
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:204593:151"/> Ages did not see an inch before their Noses, as well as we. And so, if it be once granted that those heavenly Oracles were write recently upon the transaction of those Matters which they record, and were so universally receiv'd, as we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they were, it cannot be deny'd but what they say was certainly as true, as that they say it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now that thus it was, is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly certain, as ever was any thing, that depended upon meer Testimony, as all Matters of Fact can only do. For never was any thing vouched by a more unquestionable Testimony, than that those were then write, and so receiv'd (it is all on to me if it be in behalf of any one of the four Evangelists, since any of these does our businesse, as to the Matter of Fact of the New Testament, and confirms those Books which contain that of the Old, besides what can be said upon their own score). So that, unless all the History of the World precedent to that of our own days, be quite discarded as fabulous, and chymerical (and who would not
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:204593:151"/> his such a ridiculous sceptick out of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who would do so), none can so much as make the least hover about it; There being still an uninterrupted universal Testimony thereof running thorow all the interveening Ages from <hi>that,</hi> wherein it was done, to <hi>this,</hi> wherein we do now equally own it with our Predecessors, and because they did so. Neither derive we such a suffrage only from those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours that were especially so to us in our Religion, but also from those who were so in regard of that common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect which ordinarily render's men to be such: since both Jewish and Gentile, as well as Christian Writers, do unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously concur to witnesse all that at present we desire, <hi>viz. that such Books were then write,</hi> and <hi>so publickly embrac'd.</hi> Indeed had their original been to trace backward to some indefinite time, there had been all the reason in the world to have suspect them to have stole clancu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly into the World. But when we know the years that we have to run back, and that we are oblig'd to go no farther
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:204593:152"/> length, than we use to be carried by the most certain and renown'd Histories the World now has; it were some strangely peculiar kind of dis-ingenuity, for any, more to reject the Writings of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> or St. <hi>John,</hi> than those of <hi>Livy, Salust, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But either Christianity had a being before these Books were writ and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or not? If not, but that in its very first broaching that passt? Then we have all we would. If it had, and was spread over the world, as now it is? Then how came they to be lookt upon as such, as could not but have been of an equal date with that of the Religion of whose birth they gave an account, since they carry the Names of those who were its first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Propagators? That on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Books should appear, and pretend to have been writ a considerable time ago, by men that were now dead and extinct, is so disparaging a circumstance to their authority, that he must not be versed in the import of that, who would yield them any favour. But that Books should be
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:204593:152"/> asserted to have been alwayes visible and extant, and universally receiv'd, nay and quoted by all other Books, and that since the dayes of these Authors whom they are fathered upon, when yet they were not, is so impossible to be imagin'd, that it is not more so, how a City, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that never was before, could imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly arrive to the repute of such antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as have those who can deduce their Pedegree with the most solemn and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable advantages; especially when these Books, are of no less consideration, than is, not one Town, or Countrey, but the whole World. Indeed it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for things that are not the object of Sense, such as matters of Opinion and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, to steal themselves insensibly and by slow imperceptible motions into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of an old Genealogy and Date: Nay even Practices, and such fluctuant and unsettled matters, may grow up to a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, whose first Origine and rise may not be capable to be found out by the most diligent retrogradation whatsoever. But that a fixt permanent visible thing,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:204593:153"/> such as a Book, multiplied all over the earth into almost innumerable Copies (as, according to the supposition, it was; for upon that very multiplication, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion does proceed, and may be re-stated), should now commence into the credite of having been <hi>so</hi> yesterday, when this is the first day it ever had any being, is so very unaccountable, that even any of the former Instances, about a Town or a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were infinitely less so. And that tho it be also true, that the World is pestered with many spurious and illegit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate ones, which pretend unto both Authors and Dates, which never were theirs. For never was there any such, of so <hi>universal reception</hi> and <hi>concernment,</hi> as we find the Bible to be amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and as it alwayes was, for ought that any man alive can say to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, unless it were meerly to say so. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what may be brought from other no less eminent disparties. And that there has been even supposititious Gospels, does but further confirm our Argument. For these have alwayes been detected to be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:204593:153"/> such; and unless there had been true ones, they durst never have attempted to vent themselves; as out of what has been said appears altogether palpable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to the evidence and certainty of Testimony, I know not by what Rules some have endeavoured to discredite them, as not only the lowest kind of all under those names; but as those which involves no more than do's a simple <hi>may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be;</hi> because that which, they say, may possibly be false. This is indeed an error which tends as much to overturn all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in the World, as any thing can be; as has been largely shewed by many ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Writers. But it is no greater any where, than in Philosophie. And this I undertake to demonstrate thus. A <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral certainty</hi> (for that is the certainty of Testimony) is at last refounded into that which is <hi>Metaphysical;</hi> and therefore, is no less, than is it; as is clear. That it is refounded in a <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, appears from this, that it is a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty grounded upon an event which supposes a necessary and determin'd cause,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:204593:154"/> and so which could not possibly or Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physically be otherwise, or not result from that cause. For the event upon which Moral Certainty is built, is a constant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd event flowing from a cause un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined and contingent in its own self, and therefore determin'd and necessary, as to the production of that effect, by something else. An example is this, for ten thousand times Cinques to be thrown up uninterruptedly by ten thousand seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dice; or for a million of Horses to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in a mile of way which they had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pav'd before, so, as that not one foot of 'em all does not exactly beat those same individual steps which were trode by it before. Here is a constant event, and a contingent cause, from which it proceeds. And I say that that event, providing it be, could not have been from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent cause as such, and undetermin'd by any other thing from without, even <hi>Metaphysically</hi> speaking. Since it is as necessary for a <hi>contingent cause</hi> to work <hi>contingently,</hi> or produce various, and at nearest only <hi>generically</hi> related effects; as
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:204593:154"/> for a <hi>necessary,</hi> to work <hi>necessarily,</hi> or produce such effects as are <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>specifically</hi> the same; otherwise every one might invade each others nature, and all the Metaphysicks would have nothing wherewith to limite and restrain them. And so such a contingent cause, as ten thousand Dice, left to its own intrinsick power and determination, could not run constantly in one perpetual course of Cinques, for ten thousand throws; but behov'd as much to vary the several com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of their several numbers, as proportionally the contingency which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose from their exactly cubal form, not inclining more to one side than another, and those ten thousand casual motions which gave them the fling, did require. And therefore, if such a constant curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Cinques were thrown up, it could not but be ascrib'd to something else, than meerly that contingent cause; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to that which were not so; and by a further consequence, to that which were <hi>necessary,</hi> and did produce it <hi>necessarily:</hi> Which was the thing to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:204593:155"/>5. It is true that it is not impossible that ten thousand Dice, should ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times cast up all Cinques, so that they be considered without respect, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Agent by which they are thrown: for GOD may make them do so. But as they are in the hand of such an infinite Power, which at its pleasure can order all their several motions, they cannot be lookt upon as any contingent cause, and so no wonder tho a constant event flow from them. It is also true, that, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely speaking there is an equal aptitude and exigence in all nature, even for so many Dice to be all thrown up into Cinques, a second time, and after that, a third, and so on (and that by one not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to manage and determine them any otherwise but at an adventure), that there was before they were cast at all. But as one Swallow makes not Spring, so one such accident cannot amount to make up any constant event: and as it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely considered it is but only one. Wherefore there can be no number of throws sufficient to constitute a constancy in the event, but such as is so considerable
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:204593:155"/> to fall under the rigour of that deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. And every one of them must have a respect to the whole. And for such an event to proceed from a cause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contingent, without it be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd somewhere else, than from it self, is I think sufficiently made manifest to be impossible. And therefore, since if such an event be, it behov'd to be, because from a necessary cause working necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and so could not be otherwise, or from a contingent cause; that Certainty which is built upon it, is of that nature, of which are all such, as are superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon the metaphysical necessity of things.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The only difficulty is, when there is such a constancy in the event, as thus suffices to demostrate that it was not the issue of meer Chance and Fortune. But that must be left to every mans prudent consideration, as to particular cases. It is enough to me, that in the general, such a constant event does infer a <hi>proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and therefore <hi>necessary</hi> cause. And as for the present case, there is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly such a constancy in the Testimony
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:204593:156"/> we have alledged; that even that in the number of Cinques can hardly outdo it. Besides what is to be deduc'd from the <hi>improbability of the thing written,</hi> as to its own self, and the <hi>common averseness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to embrace it,</hi> considered <hi>with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that universal reception which</hi> has been suppos'd. For that concurs with no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable moment and weight to make up the Morality of the evidence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The certainty then of our Christian Religion depends not upon any thing that could have been false. For (to go on by steps) that there is such a constant Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that these Books are genuine, is as certain, as any thing can be, that is the Object of Sense (which I suppose can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceiv'd in its due operations): That such a Testimony could not be false, is as certain, as any thing that can be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally so: That those Books could not therefore have writ things otherwise than they were, is of the like certainty. And that those things did demonstrate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible truth of that, which they asserted, is of the greatest of all. And all these, I perswade my self, are evident to every
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:204593:156"/> body who has read thus far of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

NOW we cannot dream or imagine that after Almighty GOD had gain'd the whole world to the faith and obedience of that Religion for which he had made so long, and so solemn prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and which he did propagate and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse with such irresistible and convincing evidence; He should then have abandon'd it unto all the distractions and confusions, all the enormities and irregularities, that bigot and fond zeal, or wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht nature, could hurry men into. This certainly, as it had been very unkind, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ruinous to all men, so more especially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Son of Man, and Himself too, who had so severely suffer'd and smarted for them. And therefore we must, without as much Blasphemy in us, as it would have been seeming cruelty in him, conclude, that at least he has not dealt less favourably with us upon whom the ends of the world have fal'n, than he did with those who were

And if they did provide the world with any such thing, then questionless they did also leave it so notour and conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that, nothing in all Christianity was more so. Wherefore, as all the ill success which the Gospel has had in converting mankind, unto the noblest perfections of Truth and Holiness, so all those many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements and discords, wherewith its own Professours are distracted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext, ought undoubtedly to be roll'd over upon the pravity and stubbornness of mens corrupt natures, and not upon those alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether sufficient and proper Methods which GOD has appointed to rectifie and sublime them.</p>

So that never one of them is either Christian upon the same Grounds, or yet resolves his Faith into the same Principles.
